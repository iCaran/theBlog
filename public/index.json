The Fatal Pivot (1920-1945): Subhas Chandra Bose, despite personal Vedantic sympathies, explicitly repudiated Hindu Mahasabha as \u0026ldquo;traitors\u0026rdquo; and embraced secular nationalism; his Forward Bloc represented tactical pragmatism over civilizational coherence; this created ideological vacuum subsequently exploited by communist organizers.

The Contemporary Reckoning: Bengal\u0026rsquo;s transformation represents not merely regional political history but illuminates deepest challenges facing constitutional democracy in culturally diverse societies; whether this constitutes temporary historical aberration or permanent civilizational loss remains the defining question for India\u0026rsquo;s broader constitutional experiment in balancing unity with diversity, modernity with tradition. The Bengali Paradox: From Hindu Renaissance to Communist Hegemony - A Constitutional and Civilizational Analysis Preface: The Intellectual Enigma of Bengal\u0026rsquo;s Transformation The transformation of Bengal from the epicenter of Hindu nationalist awakening to the bastion of communist ideology represents one of the most profound civilizational paradoxes in modern Indian history; a metamorphosis so complete and counterintuitive that it demands rigorous constitutional, cultural, and historical excavation. How did the very soil that nurtured Bankim Chandra Chatterjee\u0026rsquo;s Vande Mataram, Aurobindo Ghosh\u0026rsquo;s revolutionary spirituality, and the Jugantar\u0026rsquo;s secret societies ultimately embrace an ideology fundamentally antithetical to its civilizational moorings?\nI. The Golden Epoch: Bengal as the Crucible of Hindu Nationalist Consciousness The Literary and Philosophical Foundation The Bengali Renaissance, far from being merely a cultural awakening, constituted the intellectual and spiritual foundation of what would later crystallize into organized Hindu nationalist consciousness. Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (1838-1894) did not merely pen literature; he crafted a theological-political framework that sanctified the motherland as Bharat Mata—a divine feminine principle worthy of ultimate devotion. His Anandamath (1882) represented a sophisticated synthesis of Shakta theology and anti-colonial resistance, establishing devotional patriotism as both spiritual practice and political imperative.\nThe constitutional significance of this literary nationalism cannot be overstated; Chatterjee\u0026rsquo;s conception of Vande Mataram as both hymn and constitutional principle would later influence the ideological substratum of independent India\u0026rsquo;s national identity, even as secular interpretations would attempt to sanitize its explicitly Hindu theological foundations.\nThe Revolutionary Synthesis: Spirituality as Political Praxis The emergence of secret revolutionary organizations like Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti represented an unprecedented fusion of Vedantic philosophy and militant nationalism. Aurobindo Ghosh, the intellectual architect of this movement, demonstrated how ancient Hindu spiritual disciplines could be transmuted into revolutionary methodology; the very term \u0026ldquo;Yugantar\u0026rdquo; (New Era/Transition of Epochs) invoked cyclical time concepts from Hindu cosmology to justify violent resistance against colonial rule.\nConsider the constitutional implications: these organizations operated as parallel governmental structures, complete with oath-taking ceremonies rooted in Vedic ritual, hierarchical organization reflecting traditional ashrama systems, and a judicial process that drew upon dharmashastra principles. Bagha Jatin\u0026rsquo;s daily recitation of the Chandi as revolutionary discipline exemplifies how spiritual practice became constitutional methodology.\nThe Intellectual Giants: Constructing Hindu Constitutional Thought Bipin Chandra Pal\u0026rsquo;s advocacy of \u0026ldquo;New Patriotism\u0026rdquo; grounded in Vaishnav bhakti while simultaneously attacking caste discrimination and child marriage represented a sophisticated constitutional vision; one that sought to reform Hindu society from within its own theological framework rather than through wholesale Western importation. His criticism of Gandhi\u0026rsquo;s methods as rooted in \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;logic\u0026rdquo; reveals the Bengal school\u0026rsquo;s commitment to rational Hindu philosophy as the basis for political organization.\nRabindranath Tagore\u0026rsquo;s 1924 observation that \u0026ldquo;Muslims cannot confine their patriotism to any one country\u0026hellip; Meaningless ritual keeps the Hindus divided into a hundred sects. So, we are suffering from a series of defeats.\u0026rdquo; demonstrates the prescient constitutional analysis that would later manifest in Partition\u0026rsquo;s tragic vindication. Tagore\u0026rsquo;s cultural nationalism, while rejecting crude communalism, nevertheless recognized the civilizational foundations necessary for constitutional coherence.\nII. The Great Divergence: Subhas Chandra Bose and the Secular Seduction The Fatal Compromise: Universalism Over Particularism Subhas Chandra Bose, despite his personal admiration for Vedanta and Vivekananda, represented the first major Bengali leader to explicitly repudiate the Hindu Mahasabha and embrace secular nationalism. His 1940 Jhargram speech declaring \u0026ldquo;Hindu Mahasabha has desecrated religion; banish these traitors\u0026rdquo; marked a constitutional watershed—the moment when Bengal\u0026rsquo;s most charismatic leader chose abstract universal principles over civilizational rootedness.\nFrom a constitutional perspective, Bose\u0026rsquo;s Forward Bloc represented a fundamental category error; the belief that political independence could be achieved through tactical alliances (Nazi, Communist, or otherwise) without regard for the deeper civilizational coherence necessary for sustainable constitutional order. His pragmatic secularism, while tactically understandable, severed the organic connection between Bengali political leadership and its cultural foundations.\nThe Intellectual Tragedy: Winning Independence, Losing Bharatvarsha Bose won independent India but lost Bharat; he won West Bengal but lost joi bangla; he won the state but lost the soul — the profound constitutional tragedy of Bengal\u0026rsquo;s trajectory. Bose\u0026rsquo;s success in mobilizing anti-colonial sentiment through secular nationalism inadvertently prepared the ground for post-independence communist hegemony by delegitimizing Hindu cultural nationalism as \u0026ldquo;communal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;regressive.\u0026rdquo;\nConstitutional theory teaches us that successful democracies require shared cultural foundations; Bose\u0026rsquo;s rejection of Hindu nationalist legitimacy, however well-intentioned, created an ideological vacuum that communist organizers would expertly exploit.\nIII. The Communist Capture: Ideological Colonization of the Bengali Mind The Paradox of Intellectual Surrender How does \u0026ldquo;the most literate state\u0026rdquo; embrace an ideology fundamentally hostile to its civilizational heritage? The answer lies in understanding communist strategy as sophisticated constitutional subversion; not merely economic reorganization, but the systematic delegitimization of indigenous knowledge systems, spiritual practices, and cultural institutions.\nThe celebration of Ram Mohan Roy over Aurobindo Ghosh represents this ideological inversion perfectly; Roy\u0026rsquo;s collaborationist reformism becomes \u0026ldquo;progressive\u0026rdquo; while Ghosh\u0026rsquo;s revolutionary spirituality becomes \u0026ldquo;reactionary.\u0026rdquo; This historical revisionism constitutes what constitutional scholars might recognize as \u0026ldquo;cultural gerrymandering\u0026rdquo;—the manipulation of collective memory to serve partisan political ends.\nThe Bell Curve Hypothesis: Intellectual Hubris and Political Naivety Bengal\u0026rsquo;s very intellectual sophistication became its constitutional weakness. The Bengali bhadralok class, convinced of their cultural superiority, proved remarkably susceptible to Western ideological frameworks that flattered their sense of progressive enlightenment while undermining their civilizational foundations.\nThis phenomenon has profound implications for constitutional design in diverse societies; intellectual elites, divorced from popular cultural moorings, may serve as vectors for ideological colonization rather than guardians of constitutional tradition.\nIV. Constitutional Lessons: The Price of Civilizational Amnesia The Maharashtrian Counter-Example The contrast with Maharashtra illuminates Bengal\u0026rsquo;s tragedy; while Bengal abandoned its revolutionary heroes for communist icons, Maharashtra continues to celebrate Shivaji as both historical figure and constitutional inspiration. This cultural continuity has provided Maharashtra with ideological resources for resisting various forms of cultural colonization while maintaining democratic legitimacy.\nConstitutional theory suggests that successful federal systems require constituent units with strong cultural identities; Bengal\u0026rsquo;s ideological self-mutilation has reduced it from a civilizational powerhouse to a dependent state requiring constant federal intervention.\nThe Contemporary Reckoning Today\u0026rsquo;s Bengal stands as a constitutional cautionary tale; a state that possessed perhaps the richest intellectual resources for developing indigenous constitutional thought instead chose ideological self-exile. The question remains whether this transformation represents a temporary historical aberration or a permanent civilizational loss.\nConclusion: Toward Constitutional Renaissance or Continued Decline? The Bengali transformation from Hindu nationalist vanguard to communist stronghold represents more than regional political history; it illuminates fundamental questions about the relationship between cultural identity, intellectual sophistication, and constitutional stability.\nCan Bengal recover its civilizational moorings while maintaining democratic legitimacy? Or does its trajectory represent the inevitable fate of traditional societies confronted with modern ideological pressures? These questions transcend regional politics to touch upon the deepest challenges facing constitutional democracy in culturally diverse societies.\nThe answer may determine not merely Bengal\u0026rsquo;s future, but the broader success of India\u0026rsquo;s constitutional experiment in balancing unity with diversity, modernity with tradition, and political democracy with civilizational continuity. In this sense, Bengal\u0026rsquo;s story remains unfinished—a constitutional drama whose final act has yet to be written.\n","date":"July 31, 2025","permalink":"/posts/bengal_fall/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Executive Summary: Bengal\u0026rsquo;s transformation from the epicenter of Hindu nationalist awakening to communist stronghold represents a catastrophic constitutional paradox of civilizational proportions.

Engineering colleges can\u0026rsquo;t teach, graduates lack real skills despite having degrees, and society has normalized this dysfunction. We\u0026rsquo;ve created \u0026ldquo;educated-yet-ignorant\u0026rdquo; graduates who possess credentials but no competence, leading to massive resource waste and civilizational decline. The system survives through monopolistic control over degree distribution rather than educational quality.\nThe Great Abdication: How India\u0026rsquo;s Educational Institutions Became Parasites on Society\u0026rsquo;s Dreams We stand witness to one of the most devastating institutional failures of our time: the systematic transformation of India\u0026rsquo;s higher educational system from engines of human capital development into elaborate theaters of credentialism. This phenomenon—what we term educational parasitism—represents institutions that extract societal resources while providing minimal genuine value, surviving purely through monopolistic control over credentials that society has been conditioned to accept as meaningful.\n1. Defining Educational Parasitism: The Anatomy of Institutional Failure Educational parasitism occurs when learning institutions maintain their social legitimacy and economic viability not through the quality of education they provide, but through their gatekeeping function in credentialization processes. Unlike biological parasites that weaken their hosts gradually, educational parasites create a more insidious form of damage: they manufacture what we might call parha-likha-anparh—the educated-yet-ignorant graduate who possesses degrees but lacks genuine competence.\nThis represents more than mere pedagogical incompetence; it signals a fundamental breakdown in the social contract between educational institutions and society. When ninety-nine percent of engineering colleges cannot effectively teach their core subjects, we witness not isolated failures but systemic collapse masquerading as educational expansion.\n2. The Credentialization Trap: Manufacturing Human Capital Stagflation The contemporary Indian higher education landscape exhibits characteristics remarkably similar to economic stagflation—credential inflation occurring simultaneously with competency stagnation. Students spend four years in engineering programs, companies hire these graduates for roles requiring no engineering knowledge, and society perpetuates this elaborate charade because each participant benefits from maintaining the fiction.\nThis dynamic creates what economists recognize as a classic coordination failure. Educational institutions profit from fee collection without delivering education, employers fill human resource requirements on paper while conducting extensive screening processes that effectively ignore formal credentials, and students receive degrees that function primarily as expensive signaling devices rather than indicators of actual capability.\nThe most troubling aspect lies in society\u0026rsquo;s normalization of this dysfunction. We have collectively accepted that \u0026ldquo;college nahi parhayega\u0026rdquo; (colleges won\u0026rsquo;t teach)—an abdication that would be unthinkable in other sectors. We would never accept hospitals that don\u0026rsquo;t heal, courts that don\u0026rsquo;t deliver justice, or bridges that don\u0026rsquo;t bear weight, yet we have embraced educational institutions that don\u0026rsquo;t educate.\n3. The Export-Import Syndrome: Protected Markets and Innovation Deficit Indian educational institutions operate within what we might characterize as an import-substitution model of learning—they provide domestic alternatives to genuine education while remaining protected from international competition or meaningful quality assessment. Just as companies operating solely in protected domestic markets lack innovation incentives, our educational institutions face no external validation of their output quality.\nThis creates profound information asymmetries. Parents and students cannot easily assess educational quality, while employers develop elaborate screening mechanisms precisely because they cannot trust the credentials the system produces. The result is massive resource misallocation—society invests heavily in educational infrastructure that produces negative value.\nConsider the research infrastructure in premier institutions, where expensive imported equipment sits in laboratories that function more as museums than centers of innovation. PhD students describe their research environments as decorative spaces designed for publication generation rather than genuine scientific inquiry. This represents the completion of a vicious cycle where form has completely divorced from function.\n4. The Demographic Dividend Delusion: Staggered Unemployment as Policy India\u0026rsquo;s educational expansion strategy reflects what we term the \u0026ldquo;demographic dividend fallacy\u0026rdquo;—the belief that simply credentializing large numbers of people would automatically translate into economic growth. Instead, we have implemented a Chinese-style approach to unemployment management, keeping people in educational institutions longer to delay their entry into saturated job markets.\nThis strategy creates what economists call \u0026ldquo;staggered unemployment\u0026rdquo;—a system where potential joblessness is temporarily hidden within extended educational timelines rather than being addressed through genuine skill development or job creation. The recent phenomenon of major corporations indefinitely delaying onboarding for hundreds of graduates perfectly illustrates this system\u0026rsquo;s ultimate unsustainability.\n5. The Missing Markets Problem: When Money Cannot Motivate This analysis reveals a fundamental challenge that extends beyond education into broader questions of social organization. Certain essential social functions—teaching, research, military service—may require motivational structures beyond simple financial incentives. Modern market economies assume that sufficient monetary rewards can attract talent to any necessary social function, but this assumption proves inadequate for roles requiring intrinsic motivation, social prestige, or long-term commitment.\nTraditional social structures once provided non-monetary incentives through guaranteed status, social recognition, and occupational pride. The breakdown of these structures without adequate market-based alternatives has created what economists recognize as \u0026ldquo;missing markets\u0026rdquo;—areas where necessary social functions lack effective coordination mechanisms.\nThis analysis leads us to an uncomfortable but important recognition: some form of occupational specialization with social reinforcement may be economically necessary, even if we reject the oppressive aspects of historical caste systems. The challenge lies in creating such specialization through voluntary rather than hereditary mechanisms.\n6. Global Competition and the Inevitability of Reckoning India\u0026rsquo;s educational dysfunction occurs within an increasingly competitive global context. As other developing regions rapidly improve their educational systems and artificial intelligence automates routine tasks, our elaborate system of credential distribution faces inevitable obsolescence. The comparison with Sub-Saharan Africa proves particularly sobering—regions we once considered less developed are now implementing educational reforms that may soon surpass our capabilities.\nThis global competitive pressure creates what we might call \u0026ldquo;civilizational stakes.\u0026rdquo; A society that cannot effectively transmit knowledge and skills to its younger generation has placed its long-term survival at risk. We face the potential end of India\u0026rsquo;s demographic dividend not because our population is aging, but because we systematically waste human potential through institutional failure.\n","date":"July 24, 2025","permalink":"/posts/abdication_1/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: India\u0026rsquo;s higher education system has become a parasitic institution that extracts money while providing minimal education.

Colleges whose students consistently fail would be shut down. This creates direct accountability between educational quality and institutional survival, forces colleges to actually teach, and eliminates thousands of worthless degree mills while concentrating resources on institutions that work.\n1. A Promising Solution: The Universal Competency Assessment Model The path toward reform may lie in implementing a comprehensive accountability system through mandatory competency examinations—a \u0026ldquo;GATE Lite\u0026rdquo; approach that could fundamentally reshape the educational landscape. This solution deserves serious consideration as it addresses the core dysfunction while creating powerful incentives for genuine improvement.\nThe mechanism would work as follows: Every engineering graduate would be required to take a standardized competency examination covering fundamental engineering principles—essentially a simplified version of the existing GATE exam. Crucially, this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a high-stakes entrance test but rather a baseline competency assessment that every graduate must attempt after completing their degree.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how this can be advantageous: Students would receive modest financial rewards based on their performance—perhaps 1,000-2,000 rupees for decent scores. This isn\u0026rsquo;t life-changing money, but it\u0026rsquo;s enough to ensure students won\u0026rsquo;t simply boycott the exam or deliberately perform poorly. Since they\u0026rsquo;ve already invested four years in their education and are sitting for the exam anyway, most would make a reasonable effort to score well for the small monetary incentive.\nThe real power lies in institutional accountability. Colleges whose graduates consistently perform poorly on these assessments would face closure. This creates a direct link between educational quality and institutional survival—something completely absent in the current system. Suddenly, colleges would have powerful incentives to actually teach rather than merely process students through degree mills.\nThe point of this approach would be is its simplicity and resistance to gaming. Unlike entrance examinations that can be manipulated through coaching, this system measures actual learning outcomes. Colleges cannot simply teach to the test because the syllabus is already their prescribed curriculum. They would be forced to genuinely improve their teaching quality to ensure their graduates can demonstrate basic competency.\nImplementation would face predictable resistance—particularly from the thousands of substandard institutions that would face closure. However, the economic logic is compelling. Why should society continue subsidizing institutions that provide negative value? The short-term disruption of closing ineffective colleges would be vastly outweighed by the long-term benefits of concentrating resources on institutions that actually educate their students.\nThis system would also solve the information asymmetry problem plaguing students and employers. Prospective students could evaluate colleges based on their graduates\u0026rsquo; competency scores, while employers would have reliable indicators of actual capability rather than meaningless degree certificates.\n2. Implementation and Broader Implications The universal competency assessment model represents more than educational reform—it\u0026rsquo;s a mechanism for restoring genuine meritocracy to Indian society. By making institutional performance transparent and consequential, this system would naturally concentrate educational resources on effective institutions while eliminating the parasitic elements that currently drain societal resources.\nIT may be rightfully argued that closing thousands of colleges would create unemployment and social disruption. However, this perspective misses the crucial point: these institutions already fail to provide meaningful education or employment outcomes. Their closure would eliminate the elaborate fiction that wastes four years of students\u0026rsquo; lives and their families\u0026rsquo; resources while producing graduates unfit for productive employment.\nThe would logically also create powerful market incentives for innovation in education delivery. Institutions facing closure would be motivated to experiment with new teaching methods, hire competent faculty, and develop genuine expertise in their fields. The competitive pressure would drive educational innovation in ways that regulatory mandates have consistently failed to achieve.\nMoreover, this approach aligns with broader economic necessities. As global competition intensifies and artificial intelligence automates routine tasks, India desperately needs engineers capable of genuine innovation and problem-solving. The current system produces exactly the opposite—graduates trained to memorize and regurgitate information without developing analytical capabilities.\nThe financial aspects deserve particular attention. Rather than continuing to subsidize thousands of worthless institutions, society could redirect resources toward fewer, higher-quality colleges that demonstrate actual educational outcomes. This concentration of resources would enable these institutions to compete globally rather than merely existing as local degree mills.\nConclusion: The Choice Before Us We face a stark choice between comfortable delusion and uncomfortable truth. We can continue maintaining illusions about our educational achievements while our competitive position erodes, or we can confront the reality that we have constructed an elaborate system for manufacturing ignorance and begin the difficult work of reconstruction.\nThe underlying economic forces are inexorable. India cannot indefinitely sustain educational institutions that consume resources while producing negative value. The question is not whether change will come, but whether we will initiate it proactively or have it imposed upon us through competitive failure.\nThe educated-yet-ignorant graduate represents more than a product of our broken system—they embody our society\u0026rsquo;s choice of credentials over competence, appearance over substance, and comfortable delusions over difficult truths. Breaking free from this trap requires acknowledging that we have made fundamental errors in our approach to human capital development.\nOnly through such acknowledgment can we begin building educational institutions worthy of India\u0026rsquo;s aspirations and equal to the challenges of global competition. The alternative is continued decline disguised as progress, until external forces compel the reckoning we lack the courage to initiate ourselves.\n","date":"July 24, 2025","permalink":"/posts/abdication_2/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: A mandatory competency examinations system could fix India\u0026rsquo;s education crisis: mandatory competency exams for all engineering graduates with small cash rewards for decent performance.

That might seem unthinkable, yet history shows that the foundational concepts underpinning our societies were forged elsewhere: in the city-states and republics of the Mediterranean, in the rich intellectual ferment of ancient Persia and India. When Rome coined words like “politics” and “policy,” and later when Greco-Roman thinkers wrestled with the birth of natural philosophy, they were laying bricks for a future civilization that their spiritual heirs would later claim as their own—often without acknowledging the origin.\nTake the word “policy,” for instance. In Hindi it translates neatly to नीति, but in Urdu—and in many languages deeply rooted in, but not even remotely created by the Abrahamic traditions—there simply isn’t an equivalent concept; the lexicon lacks that very category. It wasn’t until the Romans distilled civic order into legal codes that the idea of systematic governance took shape. Science, too, is a Roman legacy: scientific inquiry, as we understand it, didn’t spring from desert sands but from the Hellenistic academies of Athens and Alexandria. When “white people did the science,” it wasn’t because of skin color, but because the infrastructure of critical thought—universities, libraries, schools of rhetoric—had already been constructed centuries earlier.\nFast-forward to today and you see the uneven legacy of those ancient achievements. Look at modern Islamic nations: few can boast a domestic concept of “development” beyond the immediate extraction of oil. The moment a country like the UAE decides to build infrastructure, attract tourism, or host cultural extravaganzas, it’s implicitly stepping away from strict doctrinal orthodoxy. They legalize alcohol in designated zones, erect temples in the heart of Arabia, build casinos and world-class opera houses—tiny islands of cosmopolitanism in a sea of tradition—because they know that without embracing those non-Abrahamic roots of progress, they have no economy beyond hydrocarbons.\nIndia offers a mirror too. Despite being the cradle of Indus Valley civilization, much of modern India stands metaphorically on the ashes of its own heritage. The Sanskrit word for law, the Vedantic debates on duty and polity—all of that rich tapestry has been sidelined in favor of colonial hangovers and post-colonial politics. If India had truly built on its ancient institutions rather than inheriting the Roman-Scottish legal framework via the British, its trajectory might look very different.\nThen there’s Pakistan—a geopolitical counterweight born out of India’s partition. It exists as a Frankenstein’s monster of ideas alien to its own soil, borrowing systems of governance and law without the scaffolding of deep native traditions. Half its budget goes toward servicing debt, its economy limping along, its citizens watching as it perpetually teeters on collapse or stagnation. That’s the destiny awaiting any “desert cult” that refuses to marry its faith with the institutional legacies of past civilizations.\nWhat happens when you deny the lessons of Rome, Greece, Persia, and India? You get an infinite regress—a society that never truly advances but circles endlessly, stuck in purity spirals of doctrine and tradition. No breakthroughs in science. No coherent policy. No sustainable economy. That’s the real “dark age,” not some medieval footnote but a perpetual condition.\nThe lesson is clear: faith and modernity aren’t enemies, but faith alone is woefully insufficient. To progress, societies must embrace the skeletons of ancient minds—those architects of politics, law, science, and culture—and weave them into the fabric of their own identity. Without that fusion, they risk circling forever in a desert of their own making, never finding the oasis of genuine advancement.\n","date":"July 23, 2025","permalink":"/posts/ancient_wisdom/","summary":"Imagine a world where the very ideas that make modern life possible—policy, science, economy, culture—simply didn’t exist within the faiths that now dominate swaths of our planet.

This isn\u0026rsquo;t about scattered remote work arrangements—we\u0026rsquo;re talking about comprehensive IT parks modeled after India\u0026rsquo;s successful tech infrastructure, complete with the workforce and facilities to handle large-scale operations.\nThe Economics of Labor Arbitrage The driving force behind this shift is straightforward: cost. These emerging markets offer significant labor cost advantages while maintaining the technical capabilities that global companies require. What\u0026rsquo;s particularly interesting is how quickly these countries have been able to scale their technical workforce. Unlike the decades it took India to build its massive IT ecosystem, these newer players are operating on a much smaller but more focused scale.\nThe traditional barriers to entry in the tech outsourcing market have proven less formidable than expected. Companies have always been the real educators in this space—they train their workforce according to specific needs, while academic institutions struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving industry demands. This reality makes it possible for countries to enter the outsourcing market without requiring extensive educational infrastructure development.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, the English language proficiency that Indian professionals have long considered their competitive moat is proving less critical than anticipated. Technical skills and cost-effectiveness are trumping language advantages in many scenarios.\nThe Federal Reserve\u0026rsquo;s Global Reach The current downturn in tech hiring can be traced directly to monetary policy decisions made thousands of miles away from Silicon Valley or Bangalore. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates at historically low levels to support economic recovery. However, between 2022 and 2023, rates were raised aggressively to combat rising inflation.\nThis policy shift has had cascading effects throughout the global economy. When the Fed raises interest rates, it increases the cost of borrowing for banks, which in turn affects lending rates for corporations and individuals. Higher borrowing costs mean companies are less likely to take loans for expansion or new projects. Without new investments, hiring naturally declines.\nThe mechanism is elegantly simple yet devastatingly effective. The Federal Reserve pulls one lever—interest rates—and entire industries across the globe feel the impact. Indian IT professionals find themselves competing not just with global talent but with the monetary policy decisions of the US central bank.\nThe Inflation Challenge The rate increases were a response to post-pandemic inflation that had surged well beyond the Federal Reserve\u0026rsquo;s typical 2-3% target, reaching 7-8% at its peak. The primary culprit was the massive fiscal stimulus deployed during COVID-19, including direct payments to individuals and extensive government spending programs.\nWhen you inject large amounts of cash into an economy without corresponding increases in goods and services, inflation becomes inevitable. More money chasing the same amount of goods naturally drives prices higher. The Fed\u0026rsquo;s response was to reduce money supply growth by making borrowing more expensive, theoretically cooling economic activity and bringing inflation back under control.\nWhether this approach effectively manages inflation remains an open question, but it certainly demonstrates how monetary policy decisions ripple through global markets in unexpected ways.\nThe Psychology of Markets Modern economic policy operates in a peculiar space where psychology matters as much as mathematical models. Markets are highly susceptible to speculation and sentiment—if enough participants believe something will happen, their collective actions often make it happen regardless of underlying fundamentals.\nThis creates a delicate balancing act for policymakers. Federal Reserve officials must communicate their intentions clearly enough to manage expectations while avoiding statements that could trigger unwanted market movements. The mere suggestion of future policy changes can move markets before any actual policy is implemented.\nJerome Powell\u0026rsquo;s expressions of optimism about potential rate cuts demonstrate this challenge. Central bankers operate in a world where their words carry enormous weight, making every public statement a carefully calculated move in a larger economic chess game.\nRedefining Wealth and Value Understanding these economic dynamics requires clarity about what constitutes actual wealth versus the tools we use to measure and exchange it. Real wealth consists of resources, goods, and services—the tangible things that improve human welfare. Currency is merely a facilitator of exchange, not wealth itself.\nThis distinction becomes crucial when evaluating monetary policy. During the Great Depression, for example, goods were available in markets, but people lacked the currency to purchase them. The problem wasn\u0026rsquo;t a shortage of actual wealth but a failure of the exchange mechanism.\nThis historical lesson explains why the gold standard eventually became untenable. Tying currency to a finite resource like gold creates artificial constraints on money supply that can prevent effective responses to economic crises. When your economy is growing but your currency supply is limited by gold reserves, you create unnecessary friction in markets.\nModern fiat currency systems, despite their flaws, allow for more flexible responses to economic challenges. Currency should serve one primary function: maintaining market stability and enabling efficient trade between goods and labor.\nThe New Global Landscape As monetary policy eventually shifts toward lower interest rates, tech hiring will likely recover. However, the competitive landscape will have permanently changed. Outsourcing destinations have diversified, traditional advantages have eroded, and the global talent pool has expanded significantly.\nThe Indian IT industry, which built its success on specific competitive advantages, now faces a more complex environment. Cost arbitrage opportunities exist in multiple locations, technical capabilities have spread more widely, and client companies have become more sophisticated about managing distributed teams.\nThis evolution reflects broader trends in global economics. Geographic advantages that seem permanent often prove temporary as information spreads, costs equalize, and new players enter markets. The companies and countries that thrive are those that continuously adapt rather than relying on static competitive advantages.\nManaging Complexity The intersection of global outsourcing trends and monetary policy illustrates the interconnected nature of modern economics. Decisions made in Washington affect employment in Bangalore, which influences competitive dynamics in Manila, which shapes corporate strategies in Silicon Valley.\nThis complexity makes economic forecasting extremely challenging. We\u0026rsquo;re managing systems that involve human behavior, technological change, policy decisions, and market psychology—all interacting in ways that are difficult to predict or control.\nThe current system, despite its obvious flaws and periodic crises, represents the best solution we\u0026rsquo;ve developed for coordinating economic activity across a globalized world. Previous systems, from the gold standard to centrally planned economies, had even more serious limitations.\nThe ongoing challenge isn\u0026rsquo;t to find a perfect economic system—no such thing exists—but to manage the imperfections of our current approach more effectively. This means accepting that markets will remain volatile, that policy tools are blunt instruments, and that the best we can do is try to minimize disruption while allowing beneficial changes to occur.\nThe great outsourcing shift is just another chapter in this ongoing story of global economic evolution. Companies will continue seeking cost advantages, workers will adapt to new realities, and policymakers will attempt to manage the resulting disruption through tools that may or may not work as intended. The only constant in this dynamic system is change itself.\n","date":"July 22, 2025","permalink":"/posts/it_market/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: Analyzing recent market changes and reshaping industries and the human factors involved in it presents an economic complexity that goes beyond textbook theories.

Not in the way we think of history, anyway. While civilizations around the world were busy recording kings, battles, and political events, ancient India was doing something entirely different. Or perhaps more accurately, it was deliberately not doing what everyone else was doing.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t due to inability to write, but possibly a conscious philosophical choice. Indians may have recognized that political history often becomes weaponized propaganda, choosing instead to preserve knowledge, wisdom, and social systems that could sustain civilization across millennia. The Brahmi script (parent of all Indian languages) was only deciphered in the 1800s, meaning much ancient Indian history was unknown until recently.\nThe Missing Chronicles One of the most intriguing puzzles in world history is not what ancient India wrote, but what it chose not to write. While civilizations across the globe meticulously chronicled their kings, conquests, and political upheavals, India maintained a curious silence about its own temporal affairs. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t due to illiteracy or lack of sophistication—ancient India produced vast libraries of literature on mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philosophy, and spiritual practice. Yet when it came to recording the kind of political history that other civilizations deemed essential, India largely abstained.\nSo, Why this indifference? One possibility is a philosophical focus on the eternal rather than the transient. Indian literature, from the Vedas to the Puranas, brims with explorations of existence, morality, and the cosmos, yet it rarely bothers with political chronicles. Yet, there were exceptions. In Kashmir, Kalhana’s Rajatarangini stands out as a rare chronicle, with its author advocating objectivity—a hallmark of modern history. This suggests that the concept of historical documentation existed, but it was not widely embraced, perhaps because history, most of the time anyways, is a tool for narrative control.\nThis selective documentation reveals something profound about the Indian worldview that differs fundamentally from Western approaches to knowledge and power.\nThe Brahmi Revelation The scarcity of written historical records has left modern India in an unusual position. Much of what we know about ancient India comes from secondary sources: Greek observers, Chinese pilgrims, archaeological evidence from coins and monuments, and the occasional exception like Kalhana\u0026rsquo;s Rajatarangini from Kashmir—notably, a work that begins with the author\u0026rsquo;s commitment to objective historical recording.\nThe Brahmi script, parent to most Indian languages, was only deciphered in the 1800s. This means that much of what Indians understand about their own ancient past has been reconstructed in the last two centuries, often through foreign perspectives. Emperor Ashoka stands out in historical consciousness not because Indians wrote extensively about him, but because he inscribed his thoughts on pillars and rocks that survived millennia.\nBut this also reveals something about the general Indian approach: if you didn\u0026rsquo;t write on pillars and rocks like Ashoka, your empire\u0026rsquo;s records likely perished with the empire itself. This historical gap has created a dependency on external validation and interpretation that continues to shape contemporary Indian identity struggles.\nThe Buddhist Factor Buddhism appears to have been a very recent and popular phenomenon in ancient India—you can find Buddhist remains everywhere. Buddhist sources are very well preserved, which has led to what some call \u0026ldquo;Buddhist shilling\u0026rdquo; in historical accounts. The prevalence of Buddhist archaeological remains gives Buddhism an outsized presence in our understanding of ancient Indian history.\nGeography as Destiny India\u0026rsquo;s geographical peculiarities help explain both its historical patterns and its unique social evolution. Roughly the size of Europe, India is isolated from the rest of the world by mountains and oceans, creating a distinct civilizational space. Yet within this space, the geography presents specific vulnerabilities.\nThe northwestern frontier, where the Indus Valley meets the Thar Desert, has historically served as a staging ground for invaders. This narrow corridor near present-day Delhi becomes the crucial battleground—hence the historical significance of places like Panipat. Once past this chokepoint, invaders faced the vast Indo-Gangetic plains, but the sheer size of the subcontinent created its own problems.\nEvery conqueror of India, whether indigenous or foreign, faced the same fundamental challenge: the territory was so vast that maintaining control required enormous resources, leaving little capacity to defend against the next wave of invaders. This geographical reality shaped India\u0026rsquo;s political history as much as any cultural factor.\nThe Race Question The analysis touches on something that was popular in older scholarship but seems questionable now: the idea of six races tracked into India—Negrolites, Austrolites, Mongoloids, and varieties of Aryans. The problem with this entire framework is that it assumes everyone came from outside. But the author noted a significant lack of prehistoric skeletons from India, making such racial categorizations speculative at best.\nMore interesting is the observation that Aryans definitely didn\u0026rsquo;t create Hinduism all by themselves—a theory that dominated thinking for four generations. Hinduism was already very mature by the time they arrived. The Vedas are conscious of two types of worship: Agama and Nigama. There\u0026rsquo;s the homa style (havan kund, fire rituals) and the puja style (offering flowers to symbols or idols). The more ritualistic fire-based worship came from Aryans, while puja-style worship existed before their arrival.\nThe Rig Veda being \u0026ldquo;weirdly unaware\u0026rdquo; of other races suggests that Aryans had already encountered diverse populations elsewhere, so when they arrived in India, nobody stood out as particularly odd. These different groups were already intermingling before arriving in India, making any narrative of \u0026ldquo;civilized Aryans conquering primitive locals\u0026rdquo; completely off the table.\nThe Philosophy of Non-Recording Why didn\u0026rsquo;t Indians write their political history? Several theories emerge from this philosophical void:\nThe Weaponization Theory: History, as commonly understood, is often \u0026ldquo;weaponized\u0026rdquo;—written to serve particular political narratives rather than objective truth. Ancient Indians may have recognized this inherent bias and consciously avoided creating such tools of manipulation.\nThe Inward-Looking Perspective: While other civilizations focused on external conquest and temporal power, Indian thought traditionally emphasized inward development and spiritual evolution. Political events may have been seen as ephemeral compared to eternal philosophical truths.\nThe Cyclical Worldview: Unlike linear historical progression assumed by Western thought, Indian philosophy often views time as cyclical. In such a framework, recording specific political events may seem less relevant than understanding universal patterns and principles.\nThe Continuity Paradox Here lies one of India\u0026rsquo;s greatest paradoxes: while Greeks and Romans meticulously recorded their histories, their civilizations eventually disappeared, leaving modern inhabitants of those lands with little cultural connection to their ancient past. India, which barely recorded its political history, has maintained remarkable cultural continuity across millennia.\nThis suggests a different approach to preserving what matters. Rather than recording events, India preserved processes—rituals, practices, ways of thinking, and social structures that could adapt and survive across political upheavals.\nThe Indian Way What emerges from this analysis is a picture of India as a place of peaceful coexistence, where diversity of opinion and gods was allowed. Ironically, maybe the only thing everyone agreed on was protecting cows. But there was another common theme across all schools of thought: the ideal of the Brahmin life—someone with no material wants, seeking only wisdom.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t a source of jealousy but aspiration. It represents a fundamental difference in Indian thought versus European thinking. Europeans think in hierarchies—there\u0026rsquo;s always one job at the top that everyone wants to reach. The varna system eliminated this problem by recognizing different types of essential work without creating a single competitive hierarchy.\nThe Varna System: An Alternative to Hierarchy Here\u0026rsquo;s a fascinating observation: slavery was a feature everywhere except India. In the ancient world, there weren\u0026rsquo;t that many types of professions anyway—people couldn\u0026rsquo;t easily change from one thing to another. Every job was required and had its place.\nThe conversation touches on one of the most misunderstood aspects of Indian social organization. The varna system, when viewed through a Western hierarchical lens, appears oppressive. But this interpretation may reflect European social structures more than Indian ones.\nIn European societies, social mobility typically meant climbing a single ladder of status, leading to intense competition for limited positions at the top. The varna system potentially offered a different model: multiple paths to social value and recognition, where each role was essential and respected within its domain.\nThe absence of large-scale slavery in ancient India—unlike most other civilizations—supports this interpretation. Rather than forcing unwanted labor through bondage, the varna system may have created social incentives for people to take pride in essential but unglamorous work.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t excuse later corruptions and rigidities that developed, but it suggests the original conception might have been more sophisticated than colonial-era interpretations suggested.\nThe Synthesis Challenge The conversation reveals the deep challenge facing modern India: how to understand itself authentically rather than through foreign frameworks. The influence of Greek travelers, Chinese pilgrims, and British archaeologists has been invaluable, but it may have also shaped Indian self-perception in ways that obscure indigenous ways of understanding society and history.\nThe decipherment of Brahmi script and archaeological discoveries have revealed the sophistication of ancient Indian civilization, but they\u0026rsquo;ve also highlighted how much knowledge was lost when oral traditions weren\u0026rsquo;t supplemented with written records.\nThe Foreign Perspective Problem The Greeks had thirty kings ruling parts of India for about 200 years, mainly in the edge regions of present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan. They\u0026rsquo;re credited with excellent coin-making—their coins had kings stamped on them with dates. Later Indian coins became similar. Greeks also wrote traditional history, but there\u0026rsquo;s a problem: someone like Herodotus was probably biased, sitting in courts, and may never have actually seen India himself.\nChinese travelers were better in some regards—they actually traveled throughout India. But they were pilgrims, so their entire commentary focuses on Buddhism and religion, with nothing about politics or governance. They came to document spiritual practices, not political realities.\nThe Contemporary Relevance As globalization pushes all societies toward similar economic and social models, India faces what many other cultures have confronted: the choice between maintaining distinctiveness and achieving international comparability. The conversation suggests this isn\u0026rsquo;t merely about preserving tradition, but about recovering alternative approaches to organizing society that might offer solutions to contemporary problems.\nThe Western model of social organization, based on hierarchical competition for scarce prestigious positions, creates its own problems: societies where no one wants to do essential but \u0026ldquo;low-status\u0026rdquo; work, leading to labor shortages and social dysfunction.\nConclusion: The Unwritten Wisdom India\u0026rsquo;s failure to write conventional history may not have been a failure at all, but a conscious choice reflecting different priorities and worldviews. While this choice created vulnerabilities—making the civilization harder to understand and defend against external interpretations—it also preserved something unique: a society that valued continuity over conquest, synthesis over supremacy, and process over politics.\nThe challenge for contemporary India isn\u0026rsquo;t to recreate an idealized past, but to understand the philosophical foundations that created its distinctive approach to human organization. In a world grappling with social fragmentation, environmental destruction, and the limits of purely materialistic progress, these alternative approaches to civilization may offer insights that are more valuable than any amount of recorded political history.\nThe conversation between these two thinkers reveals that sometimes the most important truths are found not in what a civilization chose to record, but in what it chose to live by instead.\n","date":"July 21, 2025","permalink":"/posts/history_mystery/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR – Summary: There\u0026rsquo;s something peculiar about Indian history that most people don\u0026rsquo;t realize—until very late in the game, Indians simply never bothered chronicling their own story.

Yet, beneath this veneer lies a growing critique: that the system, far from being neutral, systematically suppresses Hindu interests to sustain a fragile political equilibrium. Critics argue that this model—imported from the West and hastily adapted to India’s pluralistic society—has fostered division, eroded cultural identity, and prioritized expediency over justice. In its place, they propose a Dharmic alternative, rooted in India’s ancient civilizational ethos, as a more authentic and sustainable governance model.\nI. The Flawed Foundation: Democracy’s Divisive Legacy India’s democracy, modeled on Western parliamentary systems, hinges on representation and individual rights. However, in practice, it has devolved into a game of vote-bank politics, where parties vie for power by appeasing minority groups, often at the expense of the Hindu majority. This has created a paradox: a system meant to ensure equality has instead entrenched inequality, with the majority’s cultural and political agency diluted.\nVote Banks and Appeasement: The Congress Party’s post-independence strategy of cultivating Muslim and other minority vote banks set a precedent for identity-based politics. For instance, the 1986 Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, which overturned a Supreme Court ruling to appease conservative Muslim leaders, exemplifies how secularism bends to political pressure. Diffusion of Accountability: Unlike monarchies or traditional systems where rulers bore direct responsibility, India’s bureaucracy and judiciary diffuse accountability across faceless institutions. This allows the state to deflect blame while maintaining control over narratives, often portraying Hindus as the aggressors in communal conflicts. Sita Ram Goel, a leading Hindu nationalist thinker, captured this sentiment: “Secularism in its present Indian form is no more than an embodiment of anti-Hindu animus”. Arun Shourie, a former journalist and BJP minister, echoed this, arguing that secularism has been “prostituted to serve electoral ends”. The result is a democracy that thrives on keeping Hindus fragmented and pacified, slowly eroding their civilizational heritage.\nII. Historical Evidence: The State’s Suppression of Hindu Interests The critique gains traction when viewed through the lens of history. The Indian state’s handling of communal violence and terrorism reveals a pattern of narrative control, judicial bias, and selective justice that disproportionately disadvantages Hindus. Below are detailed case studies:\nA. The 1992-93 Mumbai Riots: A Tale of Two Narratives Context: Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, Mumbai descended into riots, killing 900 people—575 Muslims and 275 Hindus, per the Srikrishna Commission. State Response: The commission highlighted police bias against Hindus, noting that officers often failed to act against Muslim mobs in the first phase of violence (December 1992). Yet, the national narrative, amplified by media and secular elites, focused solely on Muslim victimhood during the second phase (January 1993), when Hindu groups like the Shiv Sena retaliated. Judicial Outcome: Despite evidence of provocation from both sides, convictions were minimal, and the state prioritized “communal harmony” over justice, effectively silencing Hindu grievances. B. The 2002 Godhra-Gujarat Riots: Erasing the Spark Context: On February 27, 2002, a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was torched in Godhra, killing 59 people. The subsequent Gujarat riots claimed 1,044 lives—790 Muslims and 254 Hindus. State Response: The initial inquiry by the Union government labeled the fire accidental, contradicting the Nanavati Commission’s finding of a premeditated attack by a Muslim mob. The secular establishment seized on the riots to vilify Hindus, sidelining the train burning as the trigger. Judicial Outcome: Narendra Modi, then Gujarat’s Chief Minister, faced relentless scrutiny, yet the Supreme Court cleared him in 2012. Meanwhile, the initial provocation faded from public discourse, cementing a one-sided narrative. C. The 2007 Samjhauta Express Bombing: Judicial Absolution Context: On February 18, 2007, bombs exploded on the Samjhauta Express, killing 68 people, mostly Muslims. Initial suspicion fell on Islamist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba, but the NIA later charged four Hindu activists, including Swami Aseemanand. State Response: The shift in focus to Hindu suspects aligned with the UPA government’s narrative of “saffron terror.” However, in 2019, all four were acquitted due to lack of evidence, prompting Pakistan to decry a “travesty of justice”. Implication: Critics argue this reflects a judiciary hesitant to convict Hindus when it risks undermining the secular facade, revealing a double standard in handling communal violence. D. The 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots: A Comparative Lens Context: Following Indira Gandhi’s assassination, Congress-led mobs killed over 3,000 Sikhs in Delhi. Unlike Hindu-majority incidents, this violence was state-sponsored, with minimal accountability. Contrast: The lack of a sustained “secular” outcry—compared to the vilification of Hindus in Gujarat—highlights a selective application of justice, where Hindu victims or perpetrators face disproportionate scrutiny. These events underscore a systemic bias: Hindu suffering is minimized, their aggressors shielded, and the majority branded as communal aggressors to preserve the secular mythos.\nIII. Intellectual Critiques: A Chorus Against Secularism India’s secular-democratic framework, intended as a beacon of neutrality and equality, stands accused of betraying its own principles, morphing into a system that suppresses the nation’s cultural core. Intellectuals such as Sita Ram Goel, Arun Shourie, Koenraad Elst, and Ram Swarup collectively argue that this model—far from fostering harmony—creates structural inequalities, undermines the Hindu majority, and clashes with India’s historical ethos. Their critique reveals a secularism that is not impartial but biased, a democracy swayed by vote-bank politics, and a legal structure that entrenches disparity under the guise of fairness.\nThe evidence of this distortion is manifold. The state’s control over Hindu temples, while sparing mosques and churches, exemplifies a systemic tilt, stripping Hindus of institutional autonomy granted to others. This is compounded by political decisions—like the reversal of the Shah Bano verdict—where justice bends to appease minorities, exposing a “pseudo-secularism” that trades principles for electoral gain. Constitutionally, the unequal treatment of religious communities cements this injustice, binding Hindus under state oversight while others remain free. Such disparities, critics contend, reflect not mere oversight but a deeper animus against Hindu identity, choking its cultural vitality.\nBeyond policy and law, the critique extends to the system’s civilizational roots. India’s secular framework, imported and ill-fitted, jars against the nation’s Dharmic traditions of pluralism and ethical governance. Where once shared values fostered unity, today’s divisive politics fracture it, prioritizing transactional appeasement over duty and justice. This alien imposition, the thinkers argue, strays from a past where harmony thrived without the need for such a rigid, biased structure. Together, their insights demand a reckoning: a call to realign governance with India’s intrinsic character, restoring cultural continuity and genuine equality.\nIV. The Philosophical Divide: A Clash of Visions Beneath the surface of this debate lies a deeper tension between two ways of understanding governance: the Western democratic ideal and India’s Dharmic tradition. The former, with its focus on individual rights and electoral contests, has shaped India’s current system. Yet, its emphasis on competition and separation often feels at odds with a society as complex as India’s. The latter, rooted in concepts of duty and harmony, offers a different path—one that some argue better suits the nation’s historical character.\nWestern democracy, as practiced in India, turns governance into a battle of numbers. Parties scramble to secure votes, often prioritizing short-term gains over long-term justice. This approach, critics contend, reduces unity to a fragile truce, where cultural identity—especially Hindu identity—becomes a bargaining chip. The result is a system where accountability scatters across institutions, and the deeper ethical questions of rule are left unanswered.\nIn contrast, the Dharmic vision, drawn from texts like the Arthashastra and the epics, centers on rajadharma—the duty of rulers to uphold justice and protect all. Leadership, in this model, derives its authority not from popularity but from adherence to moral order. Kautilya envisioned a ruler as a raja-rishi, a sage-like figure balancing power with virtue. Gandhi’s Ramarajya later echoed this, imagining a state where justice flows swiftly to every citizen, guided by duty rather than rights.\nThis philosophical divide reveals contrasting priorities. Democracy seeks fairness through majority rule, yet often stumbles in India’s diverse landscape. Dharma pursues a balanced justice, integrating diversity through shared principles. History offers glimpses of this in action: empires like Vijayanagara thrived by blending local governance with moral leadership. Such examples suggest that returning to these roots could foster a unity that democracy alone struggles to achieve—though how this might look in practice remains a question for careful exploration.\nV. Weighing it Out: The Case for A Dharmic Governance Critics of a Dharmic alternative raise pointed objections, warning of potential pitfalls. Some fear it could slide into majoritarianism, threatening minority rights in a Hindu-dominated state. Others doubt its practicality in a modern, pluralistic nation, dismissing it as an idealized dream. These concerns merit serious consideration, yet they can be met with reasoned responses grounded in history and principle.\nThe specter of majoritarianism assumes a Dharmic system would favor one group over others. Yet, its core tenets defy this. Kautilya’s writings demand equal protection for all subjects, while rulers like Ashoka demonstrated this through policies of tolerance. A governance model inspired by these ideas would not oppress but uplift, ensuring justice transcends community lines—distinct from the appeasement that marks today’s politics.\nPracticality, too, finds answers in the past. The Vijayanagara Empire balanced decentralized rule with a unifying ethos, adapting to its time. Today, this might mean tempering democracy with ethical checks, drawing on India’s own traditions rather than foreign blueprints. Far from a fantasy, it suggests a framework that evolves with the present while staying anchored in enduring values.\nSkeptics might still call it nostalgia, but the principles of duty and harmony are not bound to any era. Japan’s ability to modernize while preserving its cultural core offers a parallel: progress need not erase identity. A Dharmic approach, then, is less about turning back the clock and more about reclaiming a foundation that could steady India’s future.\nVI. Conclusion: A Call to Reimagine India India’s secular democracy, a noble experiment, now teeters on the edge of irrelevance. Its reliance on narrative control, judicial inconsistency, and minority appeasement has hollowed out its promise, leaving Hindus culturally adrift and the nation fractured. The historical record—Mumbai, Godhra, Samjhauta—reveals a state more committed to appearances than justice. Intellectuals like Goel, Shourie, and Elst expose its philosophical bankruptcy, while the Dharmic alternative offers a rooted, righteous path forward.\nThis is not a call to dismantle democracy but to transcend it. A Dharmic framework, blending ancient wisdom with modern needs, promises governance that honors India’s soul—where leaders are sages, justice is swift, and unity emerges from shared duty, not enforced equality. The choice is stark: cling to a failing mirage or embrace a renaissance that could redefine India for centuries.\n","date":"July 14, 2025","permalink":"/posts/india_demo_secu/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR – Summary: India\u0026rsquo;s secular democracy is critiqued for suppressing Hindu interests and fostering division, with historical evidence and intellectual arguments supporting a shift to a Dharmic governance model that prioritizes duty, justice, and cultural continuity while addressing concerns about majoritarianism.

Or was it Always Broken...","type":"posts"},{"content":" \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR – Summary: Based on Joe Studwell’s How Asia Works, this article argues India skipped the “land → manufacturing → finance” formula that drove East Asian growth. East Asian model: Land reform boosted small-farm output, state-led export manufacturing forced global competition, and financial control funneled capital into industry. India’s detour: Post-1991 liberalization built an IT/BPO powerhouse (\u0026lt;1% workforce) instead of a broad manufacturing base (~14% vs. 30% in East Asia). Key gaps: Democratic politics, fragmented agriculture, weak infrastructure, and orthodox economic policies have stymied mass employment and productivity gains. Takeaway: Without a gradual, cluster-focused manufacturing push—backed by infrastructure, skills, and tailored industrial policy—India risks missing the proven path to widespread prosperity. Introduction Joe Studwell\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;How Asia Works\u0026rdquo; presents a compelling case study of how Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China achieved rapid economic development through a three-step formula: land reform, export-oriented manufacturing, and financial system control. However, when examined against India\u0026rsquo;s trajectory, the book reveals not just what worked elsewhere, but what India fundamentally missed—and continues to miss—in its development strategy.\nAfter decades of economic liberalization beginning in 1991, India has pursued a unique path, leapfrogging directly into services while bypassing the manufacturing stage that characterized every other successful developing economy. This deviation from the proven East Asian model raises critical questions about India\u0026rsquo;s long-term development prospects and whether alternative pathways to prosperity are viable for large, diverse nations.\nThe East Asian Formula: Land, Manufacturing, Finance Land Reform as Foundation The East Asian success story begins with radical land redistribution. In Japan, American occupation forces mandated comprehensive land reforms in 1946, breaking up feudal estates and distributing small plots (typically 3 hectares) to tenant farmers. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t merely about social justice—it was about creating the agricultural productivity foundation necessary for industrial takeoff.\nTaiwan followed an identical model under American pressure, while South Korea implemented similar reforms. China\u0026rsquo;s story was more violent, resulting in millions of deaths during land redistribution, but ultimately achieved the same structural transformation. The key insight from Studwell\u0026rsquo;s analysis is that small-scale farming, when properly supported with infrastructure, credit, and markets, proved more productive than large estates worked by tenant labor.\nThe economic logic is straightforward: when farmers own their land, they have incentives to maximize productivity from every square meter. Combined with state investment in irrigation, fertilizers, and agricultural extension services, this created the agricultural surplus necessary to feed growing urban populations and fund industrial development.\nExport-Oriented Manufacturing: The Heart of Development The second pillar involved forcing domestic entrepreneurs into global competition through export requirements. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t the free-market capitalism that Western economists typically advocate, but rather state-directed capitalism where governments picked winners, subsidized their development, and then demanded they compete internationally.\nJapan\u0026rsquo;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) exemplified this approach. When IBM wanted to enter the Japanese market in the 1950s, MITI head Sahashi Shigeru demanded technology transfer at maximum 5% royalty rates and acceptance of government guidance on sales volumes. The message was clear: access to Japan\u0026rsquo;s domestic market came with strings attached.\nSouth Korea\u0026rsquo;s approach was even more aggressive. Park Chung-hee\u0026rsquo;s military government arrested major chaebol leaders and forced them to sign agreements pledging their assets until they met export targets. The government provided negative interest rates for export-oriented industries while maintaining high domestic interest rates. Companies had no choice but to compete internationally if they wanted to survive and grow.\nThis forced competition created rapid learning effects. Companies had to improve quality, reduce costs, and innovate to succeed in demanding export markets. The domestic market remained protected, providing revenue cushions, but export success became the ultimate measure of industrial competence.\nFinancial System Control: Directing Capital Flows The third pillar involved tight government control over financial systems to direct capital toward productive manufacturing rather than speculative activities. East Asian governments maintained control over central banks, regulated foreign investment, and often operated with negative real interest rates for savers to subsidize industrial borrowers.\nThis approach contradicted standard Washington Consensus prescriptions for financial liberalization, but it worked. Capital flowed toward manufacturing and infrastructure rather than real estate speculation or financial engineering. The result was rapid industrial development and technological upgrading.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s Alternative Path: The Service Sector Gambit The IT Services Success and Its Limitations India\u0026rsquo;s development trajectory since 1991 has been markedly different. Rather than building manufacturing capacity, India leveraged its English-speaking, technically trained workforce to become a global hub for IT services and business process outsourcing. Companies like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services became world leaders in their sectors.\nHowever, as Studwell notes, this success story has severe limitations. Despite twenty years of IT sector growth since 1991, only 3 million people out of India\u0026rsquo;s 1.2 billion population work in IT—less than 1% of the labor force. Compare this to South Korea, where 30% of the working population had moved into manufacturing after twenty years of industry-focused development.\nThe employment mathematics are stark. Even India\u0026rsquo;s most successful IT companies create far fewer jobs per unit of capital than manufacturing operations would. A semiconductor fabrication plant or automobile assembly line employs thousands of workers directly and creates ripple effects throughout the supply chain. A software services company, no matter how profitable, employs primarily high-skilled workers and generates limited downstream employment.\nThe Missing Manufacturing Base India\u0026rsquo;s manufacturing sector employs only 14% of the labor force, compared to 30% in South Korea during its high-growth phase. This represents a fundamental structural weakness. Manufacturing remains the only proven pathway for absorbing large numbers of semi-skilled workers and generating the productivity improvements necessary for middle-income status.\nThe reasons for India\u0026rsquo;s manufacturing weakness are complex but include inadequate infrastructure, regulatory complexity, labor law rigidities, and—crucially—the absence of the state-directed approach that characterized East Asian success. Indian entrepreneurs have been allowed to focus on the domestic market without export pressure, while foreign investment has often been allowed without technology transfer requirements.\nThe Policy Architecture Problem Institutional Knowledge and Leadership Quality One striking observation from comparing East Asian success stories with India\u0026rsquo;s experience concerns the quality and educational background of policy leadership. South Korea\u0026rsquo;s Park Chung-hee was well-read in economic history and explicitly modeled his approach on Meiji Japan and Prussian development strategies. Japanese leaders drew on their own successful pre-war industrialization experience.\nIndian policy leadership, by contrast, has often been influenced by Western-trained economists advocating standard liberalization prescriptions. The country has been receptive to advice from international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank, organizations that Studwell argues have a poor track record of development advice for emerging economies.\nThis represents a deeper confidence problem. East Asian leaders were willing to ignore conventional Western economic wisdom when it conflicted with their development objectives. They maintained export subsidies despite WTO restrictions, manipulated exchange rates, and protected domestic industries while forcing them to compete internationally. Indian policymakers have generally been more deferential to international opinion and orthodox economic advice.\nThe Democracy Constraint India\u0026rsquo;s democratic system, while politically valuable, creates constraints on the kind of aggressive state-directed development policies that characterized East Asian success. Korean and Chinese leaders could force major industrialists to redirect their activities, arrest non-compliant business leaders, and implement unpopular policies necessary for long-term development.\nIndian leaders face electoral pressures that make such approaches politically impossible. When the Modi government attempted modest labor law reforms or agricultural market reforms, they faced massive protests and were forced to retreat. The political economy of democracy favors policies with immediate visible benefits over long-term structural transformation.\nThis creates a fundamental tension: the proven path to rapid development may require policy tools that democratic systems cannot deploy effectively.\nContemporary Challenges and Missed Opportunities The Make in India Experiment The Modi government\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Make in India\u0026rdquo; initiative represents an attempt to address manufacturing weaknesses, but through a different approach than East Asian models. Rather than building domestic manufacturing capacity first, India has tried to attract foreign manufacturers to set up operations in India for both domestic and export markets.\nThis approach has achieved some success, with companies like Apple establishing iPhone assembly operations in India. However, it creates different dynamics than the East Asian model. Foreign companies bring their own supply chains, technologies, and management systems. Indian companies remain in subordinate roles as suppliers or assembly operators rather than developing independent technological capabilities.\nThe long-term risk is that India becomes a final assembly location without developing the engineering capabilities, component manufacturing, or brand power that characterized successful East Asian development. When these foreign companies decide to relocate operations elsewhere, India may be left with limited indigenous capabilities.\nThe Brain Drain Paradox India\u0026rsquo;s education system has produced world-class engineers, managers, and entrepreneurs. However, many of the most talented individuals emigrate to developed countries where they can earn higher wages and work with better infrastructure. This creates a paradox: India\u0026rsquo;s human capital is globally competitive, but much of it is employed outside India.\nCompanies like Google, Microsoft, and numerous Silicon Valley startups benefit from Indian talent, but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t translate into industrial development within India. The remittances sent home by overseas Indians provide foreign exchange, but they don\u0026rsquo;t create the technological spillovers and industrial clusters that domestic manufacturing would generate.\nFinancial System Structure India\u0026rsquo;s financial system has been largely liberalized since 1991, with market-determined interest rates and substantial foreign investment. While this has created more efficient capital allocation in some respects, it has also meant that the government has limited tools to direct capital toward manufacturing and infrastructure.\nEast Asian governments used financial system control to subsidize industrial development, often at the expense of savers and consumers. This was politically possible because these were largely authoritarian systems during their high-growth phases. Democratic India faces greater constraints on using such tools, even if they might be economically beneficial.\nThe Infrastructure and Geography Challenge Physical Infrastructure Deficits India\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure challenges go beyond simple under-investment. The country\u0026rsquo;s size, diversity, and federal structure create coordination problems that smaller East Asian economies didn\u0026rsquo;t face. Building efficient transportation networks, power systems, and industrial clusters across such a vast and diverse territory requires sustained, coordinated effort over decades.\nEast Asian countries could focus their infrastructure investments on relatively small geographic areas and achieve rapid results. India\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure needs are more dispersed and complex, requiring different approaches and longer timeframes.\nAgricultural Transformation Incomplete Unlike East Asian countries, India never completed the agricultural transformation that creates the foundation for industrial development. Land holdings have become increasingly fragmented through inheritance, with average farm sizes well below the optimal scale for mechanization and productivity improvement.\nThe median farm size in India is approximately 0.63 hectares, compared to the 3-hectare plots that Japanese farmers received during land reform. This fragmentation makes it difficult to achieve the agricultural productivity improvements that historically freed up labor for industrial employment.\nPolitical resistance to land consolidation remains strong, as demonstrated by the farmer protests against recent agricultural reforms. Without resolving the agricultural productivity challenge, India faces difficulties in creating the labor force mobility and agricultural surplus that industrial development requires.\nAlternative Development Models and Their Limitations The Singapore Exception City-states like Singapore represent successful service-sector-led development, but their experience may not be applicable to large continental economies. Singapore\u0026rsquo;s population of 5.9 million allows it to specialize in high-value financial and business services while importing manufactured goods and agricultural products.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s population of over 1.4 billion requires much broader-based employment generation. Even if India\u0026rsquo;s major cities could replicate Singapore\u0026rsquo;s success, they would still need to provide employment opportunities for hundreds of millions of people in smaller cities and rural areas.\nResource-Based Development Models Some countries have achieved middle-income status through natural resource extraction, but this approach has significant limitations. Resource-based economies often suffer from \u0026ldquo;Dutch disease\u0026rdquo; effects where resource exports strengthen the currency and make manufacturing uncompetitive. They also tend to be vulnerable to commodity price cycles and often fail to develop the technological capabilities necessary for sustained growth.\nIndia has significant natural resources, but not at the scale that would allow resource-based development for such a large population. Manufacturing remains the only proven pathway for generating the employment and productivity growth necessary to achieve widespread prosperity.\nLooking Forward: Policy Implications and Realistic Scenarios The Feasibility of East Asian Approaches Could India still adopt East Asian development strategies? The international context has changed significantly since the 1960s-1980s when Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan achieved their rapid growth. WTO rules make some forms of export subsidies and protectionism more difficult, though not impossible as China\u0026rsquo;s experience demonstrates.\nMore fundamentally, India\u0026rsquo;s democratic political system makes the kind of state-directed policies that characterized East Asian success more difficult to implement. The business community has become accustomed to a more liberal policy environment, and any move toward greater state direction would face significant resistance.\nGradualist Manufacturing Development A more realistic scenario might involve gradual manufacturing development over a longer timeframe. This would require policies to:\nImprove infrastructure systematically to reduce manufacturing costs Simplify regulatory processes to reduce transaction costs Develop industrial clusters around specific sectors where India has potential advantages Create incentives for domestic companies to develop export capabilities Invest in technical education and skills development aligned with manufacturing needs This approach would be slower than the East Asian model but might be more politically feasible in India\u0026rsquo;s democratic context.\nLeveraging Service Sector Success India\u0026rsquo;s service sector success, while limited in employment terms, has created financial resources and technological capabilities that could potentially support manufacturing development. IT service companies have accumulated substantial cash reserves and developed sophisticated project management capabilities.\nThese companies could potentially be incentivized to diversify into manufacturing, bringing their organizational capabilities and financial resources to bear on industrial development. This would require policy frameworks that encourage such diversification rather than allowing these companies to remain focused solely on service exports.\nConclusion: The Continuing Relevance of Manufacturing The central message of \u0026ldquo;How Asia Works\u0026rdquo; remains relevant for India: there is no substitute for manufacturing-led development for large, diverse economies seeking to achieve widespread prosperity. Service sector development, while valuable, cannot provide the employment generation and productivity growth necessary to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s experience over the past three decades demonstrates both the possibilities and limitations of alternative development paths. The country has achieved significant economic growth and created world-class companies in the service sector. However, this growth has been concentrated among the educated elite and has not transformed the broader economy in the way that manufacturing-led development transformed East Asian societies.\nThe challenge for India is whether it can still adopt manufacturing-focused development strategies three decades after beginning economic liberalization, or whether the window of opportunity has closed. The international competitive environment is more challenging now, with China dominating many manufacturing sectors and global value chains becoming more established.\nHowever, the fundamental economics of development remain unchanged. Manufacturing continues to offer the best pathway for absorbing large numbers of workers, generating productivity improvements, and creating the technological spillovers that drive sustained economic growth. For India to achieve its development aspirations, it will need to find ways to make manufacturing-led development politically and economically feasible within its democratic framework.\nThe East Asian experience provides a roadmap, but India will need to adapt these lessons to its own political, social, and economic context. The stakes could not be higher: the prosperity and stability of over one billion people may depend on getting this development strategy right.\n","date":"June 8, 2025","permalink":"/posts/how_asia_works/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR – Summary: Based on Joe Studwell’s How Asia Works, this article argues India skipped the “land → manufacturing → finance” formula that drove East Asian growth.

You can’t “prove” a framework’s basic assumptions; to critique it, adopt its premises, apply them in real life, and highlight where they fail. Living a philosophy reshapes perception through practice rather than logical debate—test guiding rules, journal results, and refine based on where they break. Philosophy as Frameworks for Sense-Making At its heart, philosophy isn’t a collection of proofs or academic jousting—it’s a toolkit, a lens through which we impose order on an otherwise hollow, abstract world. Every philosophical system—from Stoicism to Buddhist thought to Chanakya’s Nīti—is simply a model we pick up, internalize, and use to interpret our experiences. Like Newton’s laws in physics, these frameworks can explain a vast range of phenomena, but they were never meant to be universal laws invulnerable to counterexample.\nWhy You Can’t “Rationalize” the Framework Itself A common mistake is to treat a philosophy’s founding assumptions as if they were self-evident truths to be proved or disproved. But those very assumptions are the framework—they define the game’s rules. To demand a proof of those rules is like taking Euclid’s parallel postulate and asking for its derivation in the same system it underpins. If you truly want to challenge a philosophy, you must first accept its premises, then show where following those premises leads to breakdowns or contradictions in actual use. Picking apart chapter one of a text for a stray assertion misses that you’re criticizing the scaffolding on which everything else is built.\nBelief, Lived Experience, and the “Brainwash” Analogy In practice, embracing a philosophy often feels like a form of “mental training” or ritualized practice—what one might (dramatically) call a kind of intellectual “brainwash.” You’re not supposed to rationalize every precept; you’re meant to live it until it shapes how you see the world. Marcus Aurelius didn’t slog through logical proofs for every aphorism—he lived them, observed his own reactions, and refined his guidance for the next day. In the same way, Chanakya’s cautionary notes about marriage weren’t detached philosophical arguments but distilled observations from real life. To dwell endlessly on “But why this rule?” is to miss the point: the rule itself is the mechanism by which you reorder your perceptions.\nCritique Through Limitations, Not Debunking If you want to debate philosophies, don’t pull them apart line by line. Instead:\nAdopt the framework—accept its core premises as true, at least provisionally. Apply it fully—see where its guidance leads in real, messy life. Identify breakdowns—pinpoint clear cases where it fails to account for what actually happens. Only in this way do you generate a “solid” critique grounded in the model’s blind spots. Debunking single sentences or attempting to show one isolated counterexample without adopting the whole system is like saying “Newton fails for very fast objects” without appreciating that Newton himself warned where his laws would break down.\nWhy We Still Need Philosophical Frameworks The world in its raw form is chaotic and unstructured. Without some guiding map—no matter how imperfect—we flounder. Science trains us to dissect and rationalize everything, but it rarely gives us a “how to live” manual. Philosophy fills that void. Even if no single system holds the final, objective truth (and we have no guarantee of ever finding one), adopting a coherent approach to life is better than flailing in an infinite regress of “Why?” and “What if?”\nMoving Forward: Building and Testing Your Own Models Start small. Pick a handful of guiding principles—drawn from Stoicism, Buddhism, Chanakya, or your own observations—and commit to them for a set period. Observe radically. Keep a journal of when your rules succeed and when they don’t. Refine by limitations. When your framework stumbles, don’t throw it away—ask how it can be tweaked or where an entirely new premise might fit better. Share and collide. Pit different models against each other in honest dialogue. Only through this friction do we discover which elements are indispensable and which are artifacts of a thinker’s personal bias.

Instead, using smart memorization techniques and repetitive practice can help you quickly grasp key facts and patterns, saving time and mental energy. Think of it like the Fabian strategy in military history: avoid exhaustive, head-on battles (deep diving into every detail) in favor of a more efficient, balanced approach that starts with memorization and later deepens understanding.\nIntroduction Most people think you need to deeply understand everything to learn well. While understanding is important, it\u0026rsquo;s not always the best approach. When dealing with lots of study material (like exam preparation), trying to understand everything deeply can actually slow you down. Sometimes, using memory techniques is actually smarter.\nThe big question is: Is deep understanding always the best way to learn? For some types of learning, especially when dealing with large amounts of structured content, a different method might work better: memorization and practice.\nThink about big exams like JEE, GATE, or college tests. These cover huge amounts of material, and let\u0026rsquo;s be honest - you won\u0026rsquo;t find all of it interesting. In these cases, trying to deeply understand everything isn\u0026rsquo;t practical. While understanding is still valuable, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be your only strategy.\nUnderstanding vs. Memorizing When you truly understand something, it sticks with you for a long time. But when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with huge subjects - like exam preparation or advanced courses - trying to understand everything deeply can be overwhelming.\nMemory techniques are often looked down upon, but they\u0026rsquo;re actually very useful. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about mindless memorization. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s about using memory as a tool to learn efficiently, especially when dealing with lots of information.\nGood memory techniques help you learn important facts and patterns quickly, without getting stuck on every small detail.\nMaking Boring Study More Manageable Let\u0026rsquo;s face it: some study material is boring. If you try to force yourself to find everything interesting, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably give up. No amount of motivation can make you truly excited about topics you don\u0026rsquo;t care about.\nInstead of trying to make boring subjects exciting, it\u0026rsquo;s better to treat them like a simple task that needs to be done. Think of it like playing a game - you just need to practice repeatedly until you get better.\nThis approach helps you save mental energy. Instead of thinking deeply about everything, you focus on repetition and recognizing patterns. This makes it easier to handle large amounts of information without getting overwhelmed or burnt out. By staying emotionally detached, you can keep studying longer and actually achieve your goals.\nLearning from Military History Here\u0026rsquo;s a helpful story: In ancient times, the Romans usually fought their battles head-on. But when facing a brilliant enemy general named Hannibal, one Roman leader named Fabius tried something different. Instead of fighting directly, he avoided big battles and slowly wore down the enemy. This \u0026ldquo;Fabian strategy\u0026rdquo; worked better than the usual approach.\nWe can apply this same idea to studying. Instead of trying to deeply understand everything (like fighting head-on), sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s better to use memory techniques and repeated practice. This is especially true when dealing with lots of material or preparing for exams. Many students find this approach works really well.\nHow to Use This Approach The Challenge: Dealing with Boring Study Material Big exams (like JEE, GATE, college tests) have lots of content that can be boring and tiring Even in programming tests (like CodeChef, LeetCode), knowing common patterns is more important than being creative Students who practice the same problems several times often do better than those who try to figure everything out from scratch Better Study Methods: Look at solutions quickly: If you can\u0026rsquo;t solve a problem in a few minutes, study the answer instead of struggling Practice repeatedly: Do similar problems many times until they become easy Building Skills Over Time: Practice makes perfect: Solve the same problems multiple times to really learn them Stay neutral: Treat studying like a job - do what needs to be done without getting emotionally involved Reaching Your Goals: This helps you pass exams or learn new skills without getting burned out Benefits of This Approach Saves time: Memory techniques and practice help you learn faster Less tiring: Not getting emotionally involved helps you study longer Works well: Great for exams where you need to remember lots of information Adaptable: You can combine this with other study methods as needed What About the Downsides? Some people worry that memorization leads to shallow learning. But consider these points:\nNot everything needs deep understanding. Sometimes just knowing the basics is enough. Memorization can help you understand better later. Once you know the basics, deeper understanding comes more easily. You can use both methods together. Start with memorization, then work on understanding. Conclusion Both understanding and memorization have their place in learning. When dealing with lots of boring or structured material, it\u0026rsquo;s smart to use memory techniques and repeated practice. Just like Fabius succeeded by avoiding direct battles, you can succeed by using clever study strategies. The key isn\u0026rsquo;t to love everything you\u0026rsquo;re learning - it\u0026rsquo;s to find the most efficient way to learn it.\n","date":"February 24, 2025","permalink":"/posts/grind/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: Deep understanding isn’t always the best study strategy—especially when you have massive, structured, or dull material to tackle (like exam prep).

Inadequate Oversight: Bodies like NAAC, NIRF, AICTE, CBSE, and ICSE focus on ratings and guidelines, failing to enforce direct accountability. Need for Reform: Proposes the creation of direct complaint portals and independent local regulatory cells to ensure swift, impartial redressal. Empowered Student Representation: Emphasizes establishing truly independent student bodies to advocate for student rights and coordinate effective responses. Accountability Measures: Suggests strict sanctions—including temporary de-affiliation and admission suspensions—for institutions that neglect continuous monitoring and student safety. Introduction In just this year (before two whole months could elapse), extremely disturbing incidents—from the tragic suicide at KIIT University to the indignities faced by students at Carmel School, Dhanbad—have exposed deep flaws in the way student welfare is managed across our educational institutions. These events are not isolated incidents but symptomatic of a systemic failure: existing bodies like NAAC, NIRF, AICTE, CBSE, and ICSE merely offer ratings and guidelines without the robust, independent oversight necessary to protect students.\n1. The Current Landscape of Educational Oversight Regulatory bodies in India are tasked with maintaining standards through periodic assessments and ratings. However, their current mandate is limited to issuing guidelines rather than actively policing institutions. This gap creates an environment where universities and schools can, at times, act arbitrarily. For instance, in the case of KIIT University, the administration’s initial response to a student\u0026rsquo;s suicide—marked by cover-ups and harsh reprisals against protesting students—demonstrates how an institution can evade accountability when oversight is weak. Such incidents underline that ratings alone are insufficient if there are no effective mechanisms to enforce student rights and safety.\nCurrent regulatory frameworks, focused more on compliance checklists than on real-time intervention, allow institutional misconduct to continue unchecked.\n2. The Need for Direct Complaint Portals and Local Regulatory Cells A key reform is the creation of dedicated online portals where students, parents, and other stakeholders can file direct complaints against any form of abuse or neglect. Such platforms would enable:\nImmediate redressal: Providing a transparent channel for grievances that bypasses internal college hierarchies. Independent oversight: Empowering local bodies at the college, city, and state levels to investigate complaints without conflict of interest. Countries with decentralized educational oversight have shown that direct complaint mechanisms increase accountability and responsiveness. In the Indian context, a similar approach could ensure that when tragedies occur—like the abuse that led to the suicide at KIIT—students have an immediate recourse rather than relying solely on an institution’s goodwill.\nDecentralized complaint portals and local regulatory cells could transform reactive measures into proactive accountability, ensuring that every student’s voice is heard at multiple levels.\n3. Organized Student Bodies: The Missing Link One recurring problem is the absence of a truly organized and independent student body. While many institutions claim to have student welfare cells or councils, these are often run by college authorities, leading to an inherent conflict of interest. In moments of crisis, spontaneous protests—such as candle marches against institutional negligence—emerge only because there was no pre-existing, organized platform for student representation.\nOrganized student bodies can:\nAdvocate for student rights continuously: Rather than reacting only in moments of crisis, they would serve as ongoing watchdogs. Coordinate responses and collective action: Allowing for swift, unified protests that are more likely to force institutional change. Without an empowered, independent student organization, students are left vulnerable and isolated, unable to effectively challenge decisions that directly impact their lives.\nAn independent, well-organized student body is crucial to safeguard the rights of students and to act swiftly when injustices occur.\n4. Proposed Reforms: A Dual-Track Student Welfare Model To bridge these gaps, the following reforms are proposed:\n\u0026ndash; Establish Independent Regulatory Portals: Create mandatory, government-backed online portals for lodging complaints. These should be managed by local bodies with jurisdiction at the college, city, and state levels to ensure timely and impartial redressal.\n\u0026ndash; Mandatory Independent Student Bodies: Every educational institution should be required to have a student body that is not influenced by college administration. This body would: - Represent student interests independently. - Coordinate with local regulatory cells in times of crisis. - Serve as a bridge between students and higher regulatory authorities.\n\u0026ndash; Enforce Accountability through Temporary Sanctions: Institutions that fail to continuously report and address student welfare issues should face strict penalties, such as:\n- Temporary cancellation of their affiliations. - Suspension of admissions for a predetermined period (e.g., two years). Such measures would not only deter negligent practices but also ensure that institutions remain vigilant about their duty of care.\nBy enforcing tangible sanctions—such as temporary de-affiliation and admission suspensions—we can create a culture of accountability that transcends mere ratings and checklists.\nConclusion The tragedies witnessed at KIIT University and Carmel School are stark reminders of an urgent need for reform in student welfare mechanisms. It is time for regulatory bodies to move beyond providing ratings and guidelines to taking an active role in student protection. By establishing direct complaint portals, independent local regulatory cells, and empowering genuine student representation, we can create a robust system that not only holds institutions accountable but also ensures that every student is afforded the dignity, safety, and justice they deserve.\nOnly with such systemic changes can we hope to build an educational environment that is truly safe, responsive, and fair for all students.\nResources As this is an event currently in development, you can check out all the proofs of happenings below (updated in real-time):\nCheck out the documented list of events here.

Unlike other Asian nations that maintain more control over their narratives, India\u0026rsquo;s widespread use of English and vocal internal critics often leads to disproportionate amplification of its problems on the global stage. While acknowledging issues is important, the constant negative self-criticism by some Indians seeking Western validation, combined with biased Western media coverage, creates a skewed perception that undermines national confidence. The solution isn\u0026rsquo;t blind nationalism, but rather a balanced approach that celebrates achievements while pragmatically addressing challenges - similar to how countries like China and Japan maintain cultural confidence while dealing with their own issues. The key is developing a healthy self-image that neither ignores problems nor dismisses progress.\nIntroduction In the digital age, India faces distinctive criticism from both international observers and its own population. Despite being one of the fastest-growing economies with a rich cultural heritage and clear progress, the country often finds itself portrayed unfavorably online. Issues such as economic disparity, political tensions, and social challenges are magnified beyond their reality, contributing to a distorted global image.\nThis article examines the reasons behind this phenomenon, focusing particularly on a unique group within India—the \u0026ldquo;good Indians,\u0026rdquo; who, in seeking Western approval, significantly contribute to the disparagement of their own culture. Their influence raises crucial questions: Why do Indians highlight their nation\u0026rsquo;s issues so prominently, and how does this shape India\u0026rsquo;s image on the world stage?\nOveremphasis on Indian Issues A distinctive pattern in Indian online criticism is the tendency to overemphasize societal problems. While India faces real challenges—from economic inequality to infrastructure gaps and social issues—the narrative around these problems often takes on an excessively harsh tone online. This pattern appears less frequently in other cultures, where internal issues are typically kept in perspective or approached more constructively.\nThis overemphasis stems less from external observers and more from a subset of Indians themselves. Known ironically as the \u0026ldquo;good Indians,\u0026rdquo; these individuals highlight India\u0026rsquo;s problems excessively, distancing themselves from these issues to project a Western-friendly image. Often positioning themselves as \u0026ldquo;the educated\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the progressive,\u0026rdquo; this group makes India\u0026rsquo;s internal struggles appear worse to the outside world. Their criticism is quickly amplified by Western media, reinforcing negative stereotypes and narratives that prove difficult to dispel.\nConsider how a similar social issue in Japan might be handled differently. The Japanese typically view their challenges—whether high suicide rates, workplace pressures, or public health concerns—as domestic matters to address rather than flaws that define their national identity. These issues are seen not as \u0026ldquo;Japan\u0026rsquo;s failures\u0026rdquo; but as aspects of society to manage internally. Indians, by contrast, often transform even minor problems into major critiques that rapidly gain international attention.\nAspiration and Frustration: A Double-Edged Sword India holds a unique position among developing nations, combining a rapidly growing economy with deep historical and cultural roots. This swift progress breeds both pride and frustration—Indians see advancement yet yearn for more. This aspirational mindset serves as both motivator and challenge. The middle class, eager to see their nation reach the economic and social standards of developed countries, often grows impatient when change doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur rapidly enough.\nOther countries like Brazil and South Africa, though economically comparable or slightly wealthier, have reached plateaus. Their futures, while stable, lack the same sense of momentum. Yet this very progress creates pressure in India. Frustration builds because improvement, though visible, remains incomplete, leaving many Indians dissatisfied with their current circumstances.\nThis eagerness for change fuels the self-critical perspective many Indians hold. With India \u0026ldquo;in motion,\u0026rdquo; citizens become hyper-aware of every potential obstacle to progress. This awareness, combined with global connectivity, leads Indians to fixate on their problems, often amplifying them online in hopes of spurring solutions. Unfortunately, this broadcasts every challenge to the world, making it easy for outsiders to view India primarily through its difficulties.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s Exposure to Western Media and Memes India\u0026rsquo;s widespread use of English creates a unique dynamic: deep connection to Western discourse and, consequently, global scrutiny. Unlike East Asian nations, whose issues remain somewhat shielded by language barriers, India\u0026rsquo;s internal conversations are instantly accessible to international media, which often amplify local issues without full context.\nSocial media and online forums significantly shape narratives about India. National issues—from political debates to social protests and high-profile incidents—frequently become international memes. The farmer protests, for instance, garnered unprecedented global attention, drawing unexpected celebrity endorsements and worldwide coverage. Many Indians felt these events were highlighted more as ammunition for criticism than from genuine concern, especially when amplified by activists and media organizations unfamiliar with India\u0026rsquo;s complexities.\nEast Asian countries, by contrast, typically maintain more control over their domestic narratives, as seen in Japan or South Korea. When their issues reach Western audiences, it\u0026rsquo;s usually through isolated incidents rather than sustained criticism of societal flaws. India\u0026rsquo;s constant exposure, however, creates an oversized portrait of national challenges, often resulting in stereotypical depictions of a country mired in backwardness and conflict.\nThe Role of Western Influence and Media Bias Western media\u0026rsquo;s portrayal of non-Western nations, particularly developing countries, often focuses disproportionately on problems and deficiencies. India, like Russia, China, and occasionally South Korea, frequently appears as a nation besieged by obstacles that threaten progress or stability. Headlines predicting \u0026ldquo;China\u0026rsquo;s collapse\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Russia\u0026rsquo;s implosion\u0026rdquo; exemplify this prevalent Western narrative, shaping how India is perceived and criticized without proper context.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s situation stands apart, however. Western media\u0026rsquo;s criticism gains extra weight through amplification by Indians themselves who adopt similar perspectives. Many Indians provide detailed critiques of their country that align with Western narratives. Unlike China, where critics often must leave to speak freely, Indian critics typically remain within the country, lending their views additional credibility in global observers\u0026rsquo; eyes. Western media outlets treat these Indian critiques as authoritative insider perspectives, giving them significant influence in international discussions about India\u0026rsquo;s status and progress.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s Internal Critics: Useful Idiots or Agents of Change? Within India exists a distinct group of internal critics who seek inspiration externally, often pursuing Western validation. Unlike nationalist groups, which exist in every country to uphold local culture, these critics frequently echo Western criticisms of India—sometimes so extensively that they reduce complex issues to simplistic, negative narratives.\nTheir influence reaches far. Often highly educated, well-connected, and vocal in both traditional and social media, these critics shape public discourse significantly. Though sometimes well-intentioned, their criticism frequently aligns with Western portrayals of India as backward or regressive. Ironically, they sometimes serve as \u0026ldquo;useful idiots\u0026rdquo; for external interests. Various entities, from international media to ideological groups, leverage these voices to shape India\u0026rsquo;s global image in ways that serve external agendas.\nThe impact on India\u0026rsquo;s reputation proves substantial. Critics speaking from within India, or even from abroad while maintaining Indian citizenship, carry special credibility as authentic voices. This lends their critiques a legitimacy that even sensationalist Western reporting cannot match. The result: a uniquely damaging effect on India\u0026rsquo;s global image, as these critical voices unwittingly feed a cycle of negative perception that undermines national confidence.\nSolution: A Balanced National Self-Confidence India\u0026rsquo;s path forward lies not in blind nationalism but in cultivating balanced, realistic self-confidence. True progress requires a mindset that values achievements, acknowledges problems, and avoids both hyper-nationalism and excessive self-criticism. Understanding the world proves crucial—not just to recognize that other nations face significant challenges but to view India\u0026rsquo;s issues in proper perspective.\nSwami Vivekananda addressed this need for balance eloquently: \u0026ldquo;The child is taken to school, and the first thing he learns is that his father is a fool, the second thing that his grandfather is a lunatic, the third thing that all his teachers are hypocrites, the fourth that all the sacred books are lies!\u0026rdquo; His words remind us to value our heritage while pursuing progress—a balance that enables growth without sacrificing cultural confidence.\nFor Indians, understanding global realities—without idealizing Western nations as perfect—can foster stronger self-worth. While India faces challenges, it isn\u0026rsquo;t alone, and recognizing other nations\u0026rsquo; successes and struggles helps reframe India\u0026rsquo;s journey as one of strength and resilience. The goal isn\u0026rsquo;t to reject Western values or dismiss legitimate criticism but to develop a perspective that values India\u0026rsquo;s unique path and culture. Through this balanced lens, Indians can engage globally with confidence and pride.\nConfidence in One\u0026rsquo;s Own Society A key distinction between Indian society and nations like China, Japan, and South Korea lies in these countries\u0026rsquo; confidence in their systems and culture. While they acknowledge societal challenges, they prevent these issues from overshadowing achievements or defining national identity. Instead, they approach problems pragmatically, assured that their strengths outweigh their difficulties.\nChina, despite facing numerous criticisms internally and externally, doesn\u0026rsquo;t let single issues spiral into wholesale condemnation of their society. They rarely rush to discard their cultural and political systems in favor of Western models. Instead, they address problems while maintaining pride in their progress.\nJapan offers another instructive example. Despite challenges with demographic decline, workplace pressure, and social isolation, Japanese society continues celebrating its cultural distinctiveness and achievements in technology, art, and design. They seek solutions rooted in their own context rather than copying other nations wholesale. Their approach suggests: \u0026ldquo;Yes, we have problems, but look at what we\u0026rsquo;ve achieved.\u0026rdquo;\nMany Indians, conversely, view the West as utopian, seeing Western cultures as the ultimate model of societal and economic success. This often leads to dismissing India\u0026rsquo;s strengths whenever problems arise. Some suggest that every issue—whether caste, corruption, or infrastructure—requires \u0026ldquo;deleting everything\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;copy the West.\u0026rdquo; This overlooks how exchanging one set of problems for another doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee progress. Western societies have their own flaws—often overlooked by Indians.\nIndians must recognize their progress and successes as equally valuable. From maintaining a vibrant democracy to preserving cultural and linguistic diversity in unprecedented ways, India has much to celebrate. Life improves rapidly, with advances in technology, education, and infrastructure. Acknowledging these achievements while addressing challenges creates a balanced, confident national identity.\nConclusion India stands at a crucial juncture in the global narrative. It embodies immense progress, cultural depth, and potential, yet struggles with internal critics who magnify its challenges and external observers who amplify these criticisms. This creates a distorted self-image that dismisses achievements in favor of perceived shortcomings.\nMoving forward requires a more balanced perspective: one that values progress while addressing challenges without losing self-respect. Societal confidence doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean blind nationalism but rather acknowledging successes while working pragmatically on improvements. The West isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, and India isn\u0026rsquo;t the failure some portray it as.\nSwami Vivekananda\u0026rsquo;s words resonate as a powerful reminder of what happens when society loses faith in itself: \u0026ldquo;The child is taken to school, and the first thing he learns is that his father is a fool, the second thing that his grandfather is a lunatic, the third thing that all his teachers are hypocrites, the fourth that all the sacred books are lies!\u0026rdquo; These words underscore the importance of pride, balance, and context in shaping our worldview.\nIndia must stop measuring itself solely by Western standards. Every nation has unique strengths and weaknesses—no country exists without problems. By cultivating self-confidence and broader understanding, Indians can reshape their narrative—not by imitating others, but by building on their own strengths and progress.\n","date":"January 16, 2025","permalink":"/posts/india_and_criticisms/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: This article explores how India\u0026rsquo;s self-image and global perception are heavily influenced by both internal critics and Western media narratives.

Many genuinely follow altruistic values, often at their own expense, while others openly prioritize their interests—leading to frustration and betrayal. When everyone is upfront about their goals, interactions could become more transparent and mutually beneficial. Cohesive minority groups already thrive by openly advocating for their own interests, while the fragmented majority often falls short due to misplaced guilt-driven values. Embracing pragmatic self-interest could create a more functional, realistic society.\nIntroduction In a world where lofty ideals of altruism and morality guide much of our societal and political frameworks, a fundamental question arises: Does the system truly work for everyone? An honest, introspective view suggests that the world’s woes stem not from a lack of goodwill but from the illusion that everyone operates on shared ethical principles. Many suffer, not because they fail to try but because they unwittingly believe in these ideals while others pursue their self-interests openly. Perhaps, if society encouraged honest self-interest, we could achieve a more functional, transparent world.\nThe Flaws of Universal Morality Morality is often taught as an absolute, yet this notion falls apart in practice. \u0026ldquo;Value education,\u0026rdquo; as idealistic as it seems, has little grounding in real life, as people’s diverse moral compasses rarely align. Even a small number of people who disregard ethics can disrupt an entire system. Hence, it may be more practical for everyone to admit what they truly desire rather than to pretend to be motivated by universal ethics. Open self-interest could foster more genuine negotiations and solutions, as people would no longer be bound by the need to disguise their intentions under a veil of altruism.\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s world what usually happens is that one party strives for these altruistic ideals at the cost of their own self interest, this is a recipe for disaster because it also builds expectations from others to do the same, when infact, in most cases, others don\u0026rsquo;t reciprocate. This will ultimately lead to resentment and a feeling of betrayal. It would be better if both parties were honest about what they really want and then try to negotiate from there. This would be healthier as it addresses everyone\u0026rsquo;s concern and there\u0026rsquo;s no hidden expectations that might never materialise.\nMinority Coordination vs. Majority Complacency A striking pattern in societies worldwide is that minority communities often thrive despite adversity, while majority groups struggle with complacency. Small, cohesive interest groups—whether religious minorities, ethnic communities, or economic alliances—are naturally pressured to coordinate and advocate for their collective welfare. This alignment creates informed, organized groups that can consistently achieve their objectives, often besting a large but fragmented majority. By contrast, the majority often march toward self-sabotage, shackled by guilt-driven values that may not serve their actual interests.\nHuman Nature and Animal Instincts The resemblance between human and animal instincts in survival situations reveals an underlying truth: complex behavior does not necessarily equate to superior ethics or intelligence. We often extend moral sympathy to a poor person driven to crime by necessity, acknowledging that dire circumstances sometimes necessitate a return to primal behaviors. However, society frowns upon individuals who openly operate on survival-based principles, labeling such behavior as “evil.” This contradiction suggests that while humanity aspires to evolve beyond animal instincts, these instincts remain deeply embedded, manifesting especially under pressure.\nConclusion In conclusion, the pursuit of a pragmatic self-interest model, wherein individuals are encouraged to be transparent about their desires, may offer a realistic alternative to the current, idealistic frameworks. A society where individuals openly prioritize their self-interests, rather than concealing them under the guise of morality or altruism, could lead to more efficient and sincere interactions. Though this approach demands honesty—a trait that may not come easily to all—it could align more closely with the true nature of human behavior, navigating the complexities of human instincts and societal roles with a grounded, practical outlook.\n","date":"October 30, 2024","permalink":"/posts/new_approach_to_politics/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: Society could improve by encouraging honest self-interest rather than unrealistic ideals of universal morality.

While these abstractions simplify concepts for the masses, they also require faith. This faith connects individuals to the accumulated knowledge and societal structures developed over millennia. Rejecting faith often leads to a disconnection from these deep-rooted philosophies, which have historically guided and improved human societies.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Important Context At the outset, I\u0026rsquo;d like to clarify that I understand the potential of religion as a tool to control masses. Therefore, I\u0026rsquo;d like to distinguish between monotheistic religions (primarily the Abrahamic faiths) and traditional religions. The former is more of an anti-tradition compared to the latter, which is more natural, based on empirical evidence, and is a post hoc analysis of what works. This article focuses on traditional religions. With that in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s begin.\nWhat are Abstractions? In the World of Computers We can use a computer analogy to understand abstractions.\nAt the fundamental level, computers run on electric signals—high and low. To simplify, we say binary (0 \u0026amp; 1) is the computer\u0026rsquo;s language. This is the first level of abstraction. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to write instructions in binary, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to use something more English-like and convert it to binary. So we use assembly languages, and an assembler converts them to binary—a second layer of abstraction. We then use even more English-like languages and convert them into assembly, and so on. Finally, at the highest level of abstraction, we have a UI interface that anyone can use to give instructions to the computer.\nThese abstractions make it easier for us to instruct the computer, but each level also makes our interactions less powerful. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep this example in mind as we explore the rest of the idea.\nIn the World of Mathematics Mathematics is the language we use to understand the real world around us. It uses numbers to represent real-world phenomena. What makes math exceptionally difficult is the limited opportunity to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; it. While basic arithmetic is easy to visualize, more advanced math becomes incredibly \u0026ldquo;abstract.\u0026rdquo; Beyond a certain point, it becomes impossible for the average person to visualize or feel math. Individuals gifted in math can express the real world in numbers. Someone like Newton has the ability to relate math to physical phenomena of the world.\nEven though the average person can\u0026rsquo;t directly relate formulas to the real world, they can still use abstractions to avoid thinking about the underlying concept. Referring back to the computer example, a software programmer can work with programming languages and libraries without fully understanding the underlying architecture.\nFaith There are broadly two ways to understand any topic: you can feel it, or it\u0026rsquo;s down to your cognitive ability to think in abstractions.\nHowever, in the absence of both, there\u0026rsquo;s a third way to utilize a complex system to your advantage—faith.\nEven if the idea in question isn\u0026rsquo;t directly tied to any physical experience and you lack the cognitive ability to think in abstractions, you can put faith in a higher level of abstraction created by someone else. Just as the average user trusts the programmer who created the UI and uses the UI layer to achieve their goals, and students of math mostly utilize formulas they don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand, one can put faith in the higher abstracted layers of a complex system.\nReligion Tradition-based \u0026ldquo;folk religions\u0026rdquo; are not dogmatic. They perform a post hoc analysis of what works, which then turns into tradition. In the past, these religions have been the guiding principles of entire civilizations. From economics to family and the individual, religions have provided a complete framework. The modern interpretation of religion as personal worship of a \u0026ldquo;sky daddy\u0026rdquo; is naive and reductionist.\nIn reality, the existence of a higher being called \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; is of little consequence. Religion is a framework to govern societies. With this in mind, we can see interesting parallels in modern societies. Nations today follow a constitution, based on generally agreed-upon principles among the citizens. That a constitution isn\u0026rsquo;t objective truth can be inferred from the fact that countries have vastly different ideals set in their constitutions, yet they\u0026rsquo;re all still functional. Similarly, worship of the ideals set in a constitution is generally observed worldwide. A constitution is a sacred document for a country and is revered as such by its citizens.\nUpon the Rejection of Faith A religion is the abstraction of philosophies.\nIt aims to bring the realization of philosophical theories and principles to the masses and apply them to form and maintain a better society.\nIt is a method that has helped us for millennia to distinguish ourselves as a species unique in its thoughts and singular in its application of those thoughts. What it requires is faith.\nThe reason people who denounce faith suffer is that they disconnect themselves from the philosophies and human nature that comprise their culture. They abstain from millennia of thought, accumulated knowledge, and reflections. They remove themselves from the system designed for their specific needs by generations of ancestors, without realizing that their forebears designed and followed it so their progeny could have a better life and live by good morals, ensuring that the society their children inhabit is not morally apathetic.\n","date":"August 23, 2024","permalink":"/posts/abstractions/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: Religion, particularly traditional ones, serves as an abstraction of complex philosophies, much like layers in computing and mathematics.

It details an encounter with a peculiar co-passenger, a woman who seemed lost and was possibly a victim of human trafficking. This post describes the woman\u0026rsquo;s interactions with the Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) and reflects on the broader issues of job migration and human trafficking in India. Conclusion\nThe story concludes without a resolution, as I disembark at Bhubaneswar (BBS) and don\u0026rsquo;t learn the fate of the woman or whether the TTE\u0026rsquo;s suspicions were confirmed. The post and the story however, highlights the vulnerabilities of migrant workers and the systemic issues that facilitate human trafficking.\nBackground Where On a train, on the route: Howrah - Bangalore\nWhen One fine August, 2024\nWhat The train was 4 hours late, disrupting my day and giving me a stiff neck and back from sitting and waiting all day.\nWhen I finally got up, it was even more painful on my berth, as more sitting awaited me among an equally tired crowd in the same predicament as myself.\nSitting with me, however, was a woman who caught my attention. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t pinpoint what it was—maybe her overall \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m completely lost, but I can\u0026rsquo;t be obvious about it\u0026rdquo; vibe, or the fact that she looked different from everyone else in my AC coach, including myself. She frankly didn\u0026rsquo;t look well off at all\u0026hellip;\nThis one is about her.\nExperience Part 1 - Peculiar Co-Passenger She boarded with me in Howrah, and as things settled down, I noticed the man with her gave her a phone and coached her on what to say as her name when the TTE asked.\nHe left after a quick \u0026ldquo;Are you afraid?\u0026rdquo; directed at her in an attempt to reassure her. This gave me the impression that she was a first-time solo traveler. I assumed the man had a ticket for a different coach, as often happens when tickets aren\u0026rsquo;t booked together, and he went to his respective coach.\nMy stop, BBS, didn\u0026rsquo;t cover the entire route the train would take, not even half of it. I would reach in a few hours, barring delays, so I refrained from ordering food. The other guy beside me ate his lunch and then went to his upper berth.\nMine was the middle berth, and although I wanted to rest, I had to wait for my co-passenger, the woman I\u0026rsquo;ve been describing so far, to decide to rest as well so I could have my berth.\nHowever, she had different plans. She was just sitting there. Just sitting. It\u0026rsquo;s rare to find someone sitting idle in today’s age of smart distractions. I went to the washroom, not particularly worried because I had light luggage. When I returned, I saw that she had picked up all her luggage from the floor and covered the seat with it.\nShe was now taking up half the seat with herself and her multiple cloth and jute bags (jhola and bora). Well, I guess half a berth is still more space than a chair car, like my last experience. She was particularly worried about her luggage. Even in a comparatively safer AC coach, she told the other passengers to watch her luggage for her when she went to the washroom.\nPart 2 - Co-passenger Gets into Trouble The TTE arrives and asks her name, which she answers as she was instructed by the man.\nThe TTE looks at her and asks for her ID, just to be sure. Her ticket, as it happens, was under the senior citizen quota. The TTE said they are directed to check IDs for passengers with senior citizen tickets. She looked too young to be a senior citizen.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Sidenote: It is a nice quota regardless; it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get confirmed since you won’t be competing with non-seniors, who are the majority of passengers. Since she didn’t have an ID to show the TTE, she called her ‘brother’ the man, who said he would send the Aadhar shortly.\nThe TTE continued his duty in the rest of the coach and the train. He told her he would be back and would have to charge her a fine and ask her to get off if she couldn’t present a valid ID.\nPart 3 - Reflections on the Rail System At this point, I started to wonder about it. It seemed like there was some funny business after all.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e The man had instructed her to tell the TTE, \u0026ldquo;My brother is on his way home and will send the ID when he gets there.\u0026rdquo; TTEs are very skilled, in my opinion. In a coach full of passengers, they can identify potential scams. Such cases are not uncommon. One could argue that the Rail System in India is completely incompetent. People\u0026rsquo;s lives depend on traveling, especially in emergencies. What else can one do but try to \u0026lsquo;bend the rules\u0026rsquo;?\nTraveling during festive seasons is particularly troublesome, as certain busy routes get fully booked months in advance. I often find my usual routes from Bengal to Bihar completely booked half a year ahead of ‘chhath’, with waiting lists going over 200.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e These felt like stalling tactics to me. I assume the TTE thought similarly. She called her brother again and asked if he had sent her ID yet, to which the man replied he had sent one but advised not to show it. Instead, he told her to inform the TTE that he was fetching the ID, while he tried to change the name on it. One could argue that using \u0026lsquo;dalals\u0026rsquo; or brokers to bypass this isn\u0026rsquo;t morally wrong at all. What can one do in an emergency when no tickets are available? Buying tickets on the black market or traveling without one are the only two options.\nBut I argue that these dalals aggravate the already existing problem. These rackets are part of the reason people can’t get a ticket. Buying tickets en masse with different names and ages to sell them on the black market only reduces the number of already scarce tickets available.\nIt’s difficult to round them up. Buying a bunch of tickets isn’t illegal after all.\nThis is what I, and I think the TTE as well, assumed was the case with the woman at first.\nPart 4 - The Job Migrations \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e The TTE returned, adamant, and explained he has to specially check the senior citizen quota tickets. \u0026ldquo;It’s a rule,\u0026rdquo; he explained, and asked her where she was going. “Bangalore,” she replied. The TTE then asked, “What for?” “Kaaj korte,” she replied, which means “to work.” It is a problem in Bengal, as I cite a recent report: “WB loses 3 million informal jobs in the last 7 years,” the highest of any state. It is generally the poor, the economically backward classes who do unskilled informal jobs, which the educated classes of society would rather avoid with the help of education and formal jobs.\nMuch like how educated youth flock to big metropolitan cities such as Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Delhi, Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad after graduating, uneducated youths also move to these cities to look for informal jobs.\nIt’s not formally accounted for, but based on testimonies and circumstantial evidence, a huge migration occurs for the informal sector, similar to the formal ones.\nI’ve had friends speak of finding a Bengali bartender in Chennai, a Bengali repair shop in Bhubaneswar, or a Nepali momo stall in my own hometown.\nWe’ve all heard of the Nithari incident. Nithari is one of many such areas throughout the country, in every metropolitan city—in this case, Noida—where people from poorer states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar flock in such numbers that they form their own colonies. These are pockets of migrants.\nPart 5 - Stalling The TTE returned and asked if her brother had sent her ID yet. Earlier, the man had called the woman and told her to tell the TTE, “my brother is fetching the ID and will send it shortly.” When she asked if he had not sent any ID yet, the man gave a strange reply. He said that although he had sent an ID, it would be better not to show it to the TTE, and he was trying to change the name on an ID and send that instead.\nThe TTE returned and asked her to show her ID again. The woman did not know how to use WhatsApp, so she asked one of the co-passengers to open her WhatsApp and show the ID to the TTE. The co-passenger, a middle-aged man, helped her with that. The TTE saw the “ID” that was sent, and it turned out to be just the ticket, not an ID.\nI reckon the man did this because he did not want to panic the woman by admitting that he had no ID to send.\nHis plan was to play dumb and stall the ID check.\nI wondered how far it would get her though. Getting all the way through to Bangalore seemed unlikely to me. The train did not have frequent stops en route; in fact, it had 5 stops on a 2000km long one-way trip. So stalling just one station would carry her 400km before she could be forced to get off.\nShe might as well get sympathy. An alone, helpless woman being stranded in an unknown location would be a difficult decision for the TTE to make.\nPart 6 - The Trafficking Racket It was at this point that I, and I assume the TTE with me, started to consider the possibility of human trafficking.\nThink about it, a woman traveling in AC class to Bangalore to work menial odd jobs. She appeared so helpless, clueless about trains, and was evidently a villager through her accent. She was unread and couldn’t even speak a word of Hindi. The way she used the phone given to her made it clear it wasn’t natural to her. She would be completely lost in the city, but for the man…\nMy Reflections The man was probably her employer. This seems like one of those rings where they round up broke laborers from poor states, sell them the dream of money and a better life, and then supply them en masse elsewhere. There, they toil away their lives, never able to return, and are quite at the mercy of their employers, as they would be lost in the place they now find themselves working.\nSuch an employer can make them work even without a salary, by just giving them meals to keep them alive. What can someone in her position even do? Even if she found a way to get to the police and communicate with them, it would be pointless.\nOf course, the police are always in on rackets, every single time. The big pimps running the rackets always have the local thana in their pockets. Local thanas everywhere are always sold off to either the local ruling party or the local big pimps, and it continues to be so until something blows completely out of proportion and catches national public attention. Even then, nothing really happens in certain parts of the country, such as Sandeshkhali, Dinajpur.\nThis topic deserves its own article.\nThe stories she must have been fed likely included how she would earn a lot of money and how this would improve her and her family’s life. I say this because these are the stories fed to Indians who reach Arabia, only to do menial construction, cleaning, and assistant/clerk jobs, and get stranded there for life due to a lack of money to send home or even return home.\nSlave labor is well-documented in places like Dubai, where people (especially from South India) arrive with big dreams and high hopes, only to find out they have to sign a contract that says they must work a certain number of years before they can return home.\nThe Ending? Well, I got off at BBS and didn\u0026rsquo;t get the chance to see if the TTE returned, or the man, or whether she reached Bangalore, or what became of her. But in any case, this was my one memorable journey from home to college at the beginning of a new term.\nDo share your thoughts by leaving a comment. We’d love to interact.

Students should aim for a CGPA higher than the common average in their college to stay competitive.\nMuch is said about the importance of CGPA or its lack thereof to new students trying to navigate college life and to hopefully get a good job.\nThe popular belief nowadays is that CGPA does not matter and it\u0026rsquo;s only one\u0026rsquo;s skills, specifically coding skills, that matter during the recruitment process.\nHowever, this is only half true. What was originally meant by this sentiment was that CGPA alone cannot get you a job. But after it was repeated enough times, it sort of became axiomatic that CGPA itself is useless and the intended meaning was lost.\nWhat students need to understand is that CGPA is like a ticket to the recruitment process, beyond which it cannot help you anymore and you\u0026rsquo;ve only got your skills to bank on.\nIn the context of on-campus placements, most private universities have thousands of students in just the CSE branch alone, so it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for recruiters to interview each one of them.\nThey use multiple elimination rounds to shortlist a handful of candidates whom they finally consider. CGPA is the very first elimination tool. Even here, the official statements and the advice of seniors are misleading. Even though the official criteria are usually set at 7 or 7.5, when the recruiter finally releases the shortlist, one often notices that all candidates have much higher CGPAs, upwards of 8-8.5. That is because many recruiters try to pick the top X students of a branch, which ends up increasing the CGPA cut-off.\nKeeping all of this in mind, it\u0026rsquo;s advisable to maintain a high CGPA as it serves as your ticket to the later rounds of the recruitment process. How high you should aim for depends totally on your college. Some colleges are very liberal with their grading, so it would be risky to aim for the bare minimum of 7 or 7.5. One should instead pay attention to what CGPA is most common in their college and should aim to maintain higher than that number.\n","date":"August 3, 2024","permalink":"/posts/cgpa/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: The post emphasizes that while CGPA alone cannot secure a job, it is crucial as the first step in the recruitment process.
