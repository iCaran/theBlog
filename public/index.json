[{"content":" \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: This article explores how India\u0026rsquo;s self-image and global perception are heavily influenced by both internal critics and Western media narratives. Unlike other Asian nations that maintain more control over their narratives, India\u0026rsquo;s widespread use of English and vocal internal critics often leads to disproportionate amplification of its problems on the global stage. While acknowledging issues is important, the constant negative self-criticism by some Indians seeking Western validation, combined with biased Western media coverage, creates a skewed perception that undermines national confidence. The solution isn\u0026rsquo;t blind nationalism, but rather a balanced approach that celebrates achievements while pragmatically addressing challenges - similar to how countries like China and Japan maintain cultural confidence while dealing with their own issues. The key is developing a healthy self-image that neither ignores problems nor dismisses progress.\nIntroduction In the digital age, India faces distinctive criticism from both international observers and its own population. Despite being one of the fastest-growing economies with a rich cultural heritage and clear progress, the country often finds itself portrayed unfavorably online. Issues such as economic disparity, political tensions, and social challenges are magnified beyond their reality, contributing to a distorted global image.\nThis article examines the reasons behind this phenomenon, focusing particularly on a unique group within India—the \u0026ldquo;good Indians,\u0026rdquo; who, in seeking Western approval, significantly contribute to the disparagement of their own culture. Their influence raises crucial questions: Why do Indians highlight their nation\u0026rsquo;s issues so prominently, and how does this shape India\u0026rsquo;s image on the world stage?\nOveremphasis on Indian Issues A distinctive pattern in Indian online criticism is the tendency to overemphasize societal problems. While India faces real challenges—from economic inequality to infrastructure gaps and social issues—the narrative around these problems often takes on an excessively harsh tone online. This pattern appears less frequently in other cultures, where internal issues are typically kept in perspective or approached more constructively.\nThis overemphasis stems less from external observers and more from a subset of Indians themselves. Known ironically as the \u0026ldquo;good Indians,\u0026rdquo; these individuals highlight India\u0026rsquo;s problems excessively, distancing themselves from these issues to project a Western-friendly image. Often positioning themselves as \u0026ldquo;the educated\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;the progressive,\u0026rdquo; this group makes India\u0026rsquo;s internal struggles appear worse to the outside world. Their criticism is quickly amplified by Western media, reinforcing negative stereotypes and narratives that prove difficult to dispel.\nConsider how a similar social issue in Japan might be handled differently. The Japanese typically view their challenges—whether high suicide rates, workplace pressures, or public health concerns—as domestic matters to address rather than flaws that define their national identity. These issues are seen not as \u0026ldquo;Japan\u0026rsquo;s failures\u0026rdquo; but as aspects of society to manage internally. Indians, by contrast, often transform even minor problems into major critiques that rapidly gain international attention.\nAspiration and Frustration: A Double-Edged Sword India holds a unique position among developing nations, combining a rapidly growing economy with deep historical and cultural roots. This swift progress breeds both pride and frustration—Indians see advancement yet yearn for more. This aspirational mindset serves as both motivator and challenge. The middle class, eager to see their nation reach the economic and social standards of developed countries, often grows impatient when change doesn\u0026rsquo;t occur rapidly enough.\nOther countries like Brazil and South Africa, though economically comparable or slightly wealthier, have reached plateaus. Their futures, while stable, lack the same sense of momentum. Yet this very progress creates pressure in India. Frustration builds because improvement, though visible, remains incomplete, leaving many Indians dissatisfied with their current circumstances.\nThis eagerness for change fuels the self-critical perspective many Indians hold. With India \u0026ldquo;in motion,\u0026rdquo; citizens become hyper-aware of every potential obstacle to progress. This awareness, combined with global connectivity, leads Indians to fixate on their problems, often amplifying them online in hopes of spurring solutions. Unfortunately, this broadcasts every challenge to the world, making it easy for outsiders to view India primarily through its difficulties.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s Exposure to Western Media and Memes India\u0026rsquo;s widespread use of English creates a unique dynamic: deep connection to Western discourse and, consequently, global scrutiny. Unlike East Asian nations, whose issues remain somewhat shielded by language barriers, India\u0026rsquo;s internal conversations are instantly accessible to international media, which often amplify local issues without full context.\nSocial media and online forums significantly shape narratives about India. National issues—from political debates to social protests and high-profile incidents—frequently become international memes. The farmer protests, for instance, garnered unprecedented global attention, drawing unexpected celebrity endorsements and worldwide coverage. Many Indians felt these events were highlighted more as ammunition for criticism than from genuine concern, especially when amplified by activists and media organizations unfamiliar with India\u0026rsquo;s complexities.\nEast Asian countries, by contrast, typically maintain more control over their domestic narratives, as seen in Japan or South Korea. When their issues reach Western audiences, it\u0026rsquo;s usually through isolated incidents rather than sustained criticism of societal flaws. India\u0026rsquo;s constant exposure, however, creates an oversized portrait of national challenges, often resulting in stereotypical depictions of a country mired in backwardness and conflict.\nThe Role of Western Influence and Media Bias Western media\u0026rsquo;s portrayal of non-Western nations, particularly developing countries, often focuses disproportionately on problems and deficiencies. India, like Russia, China, and occasionally South Korea, frequently appears as a nation besieged by obstacles that threaten progress or stability. Headlines predicting \u0026ldquo;China\u0026rsquo;s collapse\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Russia\u0026rsquo;s implosion\u0026rdquo; exemplify this prevalent Western narrative, shaping how India is perceived and criticized without proper context.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s situation stands apart, however. Western media\u0026rsquo;s criticism gains extra weight through amplification by Indians themselves who adopt similar perspectives. Many Indians provide detailed critiques of their country that align with Western narratives. Unlike China, where critics often must leave to speak freely, Indian critics typically remain within the country, lending their views additional credibility in global observers\u0026rsquo; eyes. Western media outlets treat these Indian critiques as authoritative insider perspectives, giving them significant influence in international discussions about India\u0026rsquo;s status and progress.\nIndia\u0026rsquo;s Internal Critics: Useful Idiots or Agents of Change? Within India exists a distinct group of internal critics who seek inspiration externally, often pursuing Western validation. Unlike nationalist groups, which exist in every country to uphold local culture, these critics frequently echo Western criticisms of India—sometimes so extensively that they reduce complex issues to simplistic, negative narratives.\nTheir influence reaches far. Often highly educated, well-connected, and vocal in both traditional and social media, these critics shape public discourse significantly. Though sometimes well-intentioned, their criticism frequently aligns with Western portrayals of India as backward or regressive. Ironically, they sometimes serve as \u0026ldquo;useful idiots\u0026rdquo; for external interests. Various entities, from international media to ideological groups, leverage these voices to shape India\u0026rsquo;s global image in ways that serve external agendas.\nThe impact on India\u0026rsquo;s reputation proves substantial. Critics speaking from within India, or even from abroad while maintaining Indian citizenship, carry special credibility as authentic voices. This lends their critiques a legitimacy that even sensationalist Western reporting cannot match. The result: a uniquely damaging effect on India\u0026rsquo;s global image, as these critical voices unwittingly feed a cycle of negative perception that undermines national confidence.\nSolution: A Balanced National Self-Confidence India\u0026rsquo;s path forward lies not in blind nationalism but in cultivating balanced, realistic self-confidence. True progress requires a mindset that values achievements, acknowledges problems, and avoids both hyper-nationalism and excessive self-criticism. Understanding the world proves crucial—not just to recognize that other nations face significant challenges but to view India\u0026rsquo;s issues in proper perspective.\nSwami Vivekananda addressed this need for balance eloquently: \u0026ldquo;The child is taken to school, and the first thing he learns is that his father is a fool, the second thing that his grandfather is a lunatic, the third thing that all his teachers are hypocrites, the fourth that all the sacred books are lies!\u0026rdquo; His words remind us to value our heritage while pursuing progress—a balance that enables growth without sacrificing cultural confidence.\nFor Indians, understanding global realities—without idealizing Western nations as perfect—can foster stronger self-worth. While India faces challenges, it isn\u0026rsquo;t alone, and recognizing other nations\u0026rsquo; successes and struggles helps reframe India\u0026rsquo;s journey as one of strength and resilience. The goal isn\u0026rsquo;t to reject Western values or dismiss legitimate criticism but to develop a perspective that values India\u0026rsquo;s unique path and culture. Through this balanced lens, Indians can engage globally with confidence and pride.\nConfidence in One\u0026rsquo;s Own Society A key distinction between Indian society and nations like China, Japan, and South Korea lies in these countries\u0026rsquo; confidence in their systems and culture. While they acknowledge societal challenges, they prevent these issues from overshadowing achievements or defining national identity. Instead, they approach problems pragmatically, assured that their strengths outweigh their difficulties.\nChina, despite facing numerous criticisms internally and externally, doesn\u0026rsquo;t let single issues spiral into wholesale condemnation of their society. They rarely rush to discard their cultural and political systems in favor of Western models. Instead, they address problems while maintaining pride in their progress.\nJapan offers another instructive example. Despite challenges with demographic decline, workplace pressure, and social isolation, Japanese society continues celebrating its cultural distinctiveness and achievements in technology, art, and design. They seek solutions rooted in their own context rather than copying other nations wholesale. Their approach suggests: \u0026ldquo;Yes, we have problems, but look at what we\u0026rsquo;ve achieved.\u0026rdquo;\nMany Indians, conversely, view the West as utopian, seeing Western cultures as the ultimate model of societal and economic success. This often leads to dismissing India\u0026rsquo;s strengths whenever problems arise. Some suggest that every issue—whether caste, corruption, or infrastructure—requires \u0026ldquo;deleting everything\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;copy the West.\u0026rdquo; This overlooks how exchanging one set of problems for another doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee progress. Western societies have their own flaws—often overlooked by Indians.\nIndians must recognize their progress and successes as equally valuable. From maintaining a vibrant democracy to preserving cultural and linguistic diversity in unprecedented ways, India has much to celebrate. Life improves rapidly, with advances in technology, education, and infrastructure. Acknowledging these achievements while addressing challenges creates a balanced, confident national identity.\nConclusion India stands at a crucial juncture in the global narrative. It embodies immense progress, cultural depth, and potential, yet struggles with internal critics who magnify its challenges and external observers who amplify these criticisms. This creates a distorted self-image that dismisses achievements in favor of perceived shortcomings.\nMoving forward requires a more balanced perspective: one that values progress while addressing challenges without losing self-respect. Societal confidence doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean blind nationalism but rather acknowledging successes while working pragmatically on improvements. The West isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, and India isn\u0026rsquo;t the failure some portray it as.\nSwami Vivekananda\u0026rsquo;s words resonate as a powerful reminder of what happens when society loses faith in itself: \u0026ldquo;The child is taken to school, and the first thing he learns is that his father is a fool, the second thing that his grandfather is a lunatic, the third thing that all his teachers are hypocrites, the fourth that all the sacred books are lies!\u0026rdquo; These words underscore the importance of pride, balance, and context in shaping our worldview.\nIndia must stop measuring itself solely by Western standards. Every nation has unique strengths and weaknesses—no country exists without problems. By cultivating self-confidence and broader understanding, Indians can reshape their narrative—not by imitating others, but by building on their own strengths and progress.\n","date":"January 16, 2025","permalink":"/posts/india_and_criticisms/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: This article explores how India\u0026rsquo;s self-image and global perception are heavily influenced by both internal critics and Western media narratives.

Many genuinely follow altruistic values, often at their own expense, while others openly prioritize their interests—leading to frustration and betrayal. When everyone is upfront about their goals, interactions could become more transparent and mutually beneficial. Cohesive minority groups already thrive by openly advocating for their own interests, while the fragmented majority often falls short due to misplaced guilt-driven values. Embracing pragmatic self-interest could create a more functional, realistic society.\nIntroduction In a world where lofty ideals of altruism and morality guide much of our societal and political frameworks, a fundamental question arises: Does the system truly work for everyone? An honest, introspective view suggests that the world’s woes stem not from a lack of goodwill but from the illusion that everyone operates on shared ethical principles. Many suffer, not because they fail to try but because they unwittingly believe in these ideals while others pursue their self-interests openly. Perhaps, if society encouraged honest self-interest, we could achieve a more functional, transparent world.\nThe Flaws of Universal Morality Morality is often taught as an absolute, yet this notion falls apart in practice. \u0026ldquo;Value education,\u0026rdquo; as idealistic as it seems, has little grounding in real life, as people’s diverse moral compasses rarely align. Even a small number of people who disregard ethics can disrupt an entire system. Hence, it may be more practical for everyone to admit what they truly desire rather than to pretend to be motivated by universal ethics. Open self-interest could foster more genuine negotiations and solutions, as people would no longer be bound by the need to disguise their intentions under a veil of altruism.\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s world what usually happens is that one party strives for these altruistic ideals at the cost of their own self interest, this is a recipe for disaster because it also builds expectations from others to do the same, when infact, in most cases, others don\u0026rsquo;t reciprocate. This will ultimately lead to resentment and a feeling of betrayal. It would be better if both parties were honest about what they really want and then try to negotiate from there. This would be healthier as it addresses everyone\u0026rsquo;s concern and there\u0026rsquo;s no hidden expectations that might never materialise.\nMinority Coordination vs. Majority Complacency A striking pattern in societies worldwide is that minority communities often thrive despite adversity, while majority groups struggle with complacency. Small, cohesive interest groups—whether religious minorities, ethnic communities, or economic alliances—are naturally pressured to coordinate and advocate for their collective welfare. This alignment creates informed, organized groups that can consistently achieve their objectives, often besting a large but fragmented majority. By contrast, the majority often march toward self-sabotage, shackled by guilt-driven values that may not serve their actual interests.\nHuman Nature and Animal Instincts The resemblance between human and animal instincts in survival situations reveals an underlying truth: complex behavior does not necessarily equate to superior ethics or intelligence. We often extend moral sympathy to a poor person driven to crime by necessity, acknowledging that dire circumstances sometimes necessitate a return to primal behaviors. However, society frowns upon individuals who openly operate on survival-based principles, labeling such behavior as “evil.” This contradiction suggests that while humanity aspires to evolve beyond animal instincts, these instincts remain deeply embedded, manifesting especially under pressure.\nConclusion In conclusion, the pursuit of a pragmatic self-interest model, wherein individuals are encouraged to be transparent about their desires, may offer a realistic alternative to the current, idealistic frameworks. A society where individuals openly prioritize their self-interests, rather than concealing them under the guise of morality or altruism, could lead to more efficient and sincere interactions. Though this approach demands honesty—a trait that may not come easily to all—it could align more closely with the true nature of human behavior, navigating the complexities of human instincts and societal roles with a grounded, practical outlook.\n","date":"October 30, 2024","permalink":"/posts/new_approach_to_politics/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: Society could improve by encouraging honest self-interest rather than unrealistic ideals of universal morality.

While these abstractions simplify concepts for the masses, they also require faith. This faith connects individuals to the accumulated knowledge and societal structures developed over millennia. Rejecting faith often leads to a disconnection from these deep-rooted philosophies, which have historically guided and improved human societies.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Important Context At the outset, I\u0026rsquo;d like to clarify that I understand the potential of religion as a tool to control masses. Therefore, I\u0026rsquo;d like to distinguish between monotheistic religions (primarily the Abrahamic faiths) and traditional religions. The former is more of an anti-tradition compared to the latter, which is more natural, based on empirical evidence, and is a post hoc analysis of what works. This article focuses on traditional religions. With that in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s begin.\nWhat are Abstractions? In the World of Computers We can use a computer analogy to understand abstractions.\nAt the fundamental level, computers run on electric signals—high and low. To simplify, we say binary (0 \u0026amp; 1) is the computer\u0026rsquo;s language. This is the first level of abstraction. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to write instructions in binary, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to use something more English-like and convert it to binary. So we use assembly languages, and an assembler converts them to binary—a second layer of abstraction. We then use even more English-like languages and convert them into assembly, and so on. Finally, at the highest level of abstraction, we have a UI interface that anyone can use to give instructions to the computer.\nThese abstractions make it easier for us to instruct the computer, but each level also makes our interactions less powerful. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep this example in mind as we explore the rest of the idea.\nIn the World of Mathematics Mathematics is the language we use to understand the real world around us. It uses numbers to represent real-world phenomena. What makes math exceptionally difficult is the limited opportunity to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; it. While basic arithmetic is easy to visualize, more advanced math becomes incredibly \u0026ldquo;abstract.\u0026rdquo; Beyond a certain point, it becomes impossible for the average person to visualize or feel math. Individuals gifted in math can express the real world in numbers. Someone like Newton has the ability to relate math to physical phenomena of the world.\nEven though the average person can\u0026rsquo;t directly relate formulas to the real world, they can still use abstractions to avoid thinking about the underlying concept. Referring back to the computer example, a software programmer can work with programming languages and libraries without fully understanding the underlying architecture.\nFaith There are broadly two ways to understand any topic: you can feel it, or it\u0026rsquo;s down to your cognitive ability to think in abstractions.\nHowever, in the absence of both, there\u0026rsquo;s a third way to utilize a complex system to your advantage—faith.\nEven if the idea in question isn\u0026rsquo;t directly tied to any physical experience and you lack the cognitive ability to think in abstractions, you can put faith in a higher level of abstraction created by someone else. Just as the average user trusts the programmer who created the UI and uses the UI layer to achieve their goals, and students of math mostly utilize formulas they don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand, one can put faith in the higher abstracted layers of a complex system.\nReligion Tradition-based \u0026ldquo;folk religions\u0026rdquo; are not dogmatic. They perform a post hoc analysis of what works, which then turns into tradition. In the past, these religions have been the guiding principles of entire civilizations. From economics to family and the individual, religions have provided a complete framework. The modern interpretation of religion as personal worship of a \u0026ldquo;sky daddy\u0026rdquo; is naive and reductionist.\nIn reality, the existence of a higher being called \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; is of little consequence. Religion is a framework to govern societies. With this in mind, we can see interesting parallels in modern societies. Nations today follow a constitution, based on generally agreed-upon principles among the citizens. That a constitution isn\u0026rsquo;t objective truth can be inferred from the fact that countries have vastly different ideals set in their constitutions, yet they\u0026rsquo;re all still functional. Similarly, worship of the ideals set in a constitution is generally observed worldwide. A constitution is a sacred document for a country and is revered as such by its citizens.\nUpon the Rejection of Faith A religion is the abstraction of philosophies.\nIt aims to bring the realization of philosophical theories and principles to the masses and apply them to form and maintain a better society.\nIt is a method that has helped us for millennia to distinguish ourselves as a species unique in its thoughts and singular in its application of those thoughts. What it requires is faith.\nThe reason people who denounce faith suffer is that they disconnect themselves from the philosophies and human nature that comprise their culture. They abstain from millennia of thought, accumulated knowledge, and reflections. They remove themselves from the system designed for their specific needs by generations of ancestors, without realizing that their forebears designed and followed it so their progeny could have a better life and live by good morals, ensuring that the society their children inhabit is not morally apathetic.\n","date":"August 23, 2024","permalink":"/posts/abstractions/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: Religion, particularly traditional ones, serves as an abstraction of complex philosophies, much like layers in computing and mathematics.

It details an encounter with a peculiar co-passenger, a woman who seemed lost and was possibly a victim of human trafficking. This post describes the woman\u0026rsquo;s interactions with the Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) and reflects on the broader issues of job migration and human trafficking in India. Conclusion\nThe story concludes without a resolution, as I disembark at Bhubaneswar (BBS) and don\u0026rsquo;t learn the fate of the woman or whether the TTE\u0026rsquo;s suspicions were confirmed. The post and the story however, highlights the vulnerabilities of migrant workers and the systemic issues that facilitate human trafficking.\nBackground Where On a train, on the route: Howrah - Bangalore\nWhen One fine August, 2024\nWhat The train was 4 hours late, disrupting my day and giving me a stiff neck and back from sitting and waiting all day.\nWhen I finally got up, it was even more painful on my berth, as more sitting awaited me among an equally tired crowd in the same predicament as myself.\nSitting with me, however, was a woman who caught my attention. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t pinpoint what it was—maybe her overall \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m completely lost, but I can\u0026rsquo;t be obvious about it\u0026rdquo; vibe, or the fact that she looked different from everyone else in my AC coach, including myself. She frankly didn\u0026rsquo;t look well off at all\u0026hellip;\nThis one is about her.\nExperience Part 1 - Peculiar Co-Passenger She boarded with me in Howrah, and as things settled down, I noticed the man with her gave her a phone and coached her on what to say as her name when the TTE asked.\nHe left after a quick \u0026ldquo;Are you afraid?\u0026rdquo; directed at her in an attempt to reassure her. This gave me the impression that she was a first-time solo traveler. I assumed the man had a ticket for a different coach, as often happens when tickets aren\u0026rsquo;t booked together, and he went to his respective coach.\nMy stop, BBS, didn\u0026rsquo;t cover the entire route the train would take, not even half of it. I would reach in a few hours, barring delays, so I refrained from ordering food. The other guy beside me ate his lunch and then went to his upper berth.\nMine was the middle berth, and although I wanted to rest, I had to wait for my co-passenger, the woman I\u0026rsquo;ve been describing so far, to decide to rest as well so I could have my berth.\nHowever, she had different plans. She was just sitting there. Just sitting. It\u0026rsquo;s rare to find someone sitting idle in today’s age of smart distractions. I went to the washroom, not particularly worried because I had light luggage. When I returned, I saw that she had picked up all her luggage from the floor and covered the seat with it.\nShe was now taking up half the seat with herself and her multiple cloth and jute bags (jhola and bora). Well, I guess half a berth is still more space than a chair car, like my last experience. She was particularly worried about her luggage. Even in a comparatively safer AC coach, she told the other passengers to watch her luggage for her when she went to the washroom.\nPart 2 - Co-passenger Gets into Trouble The TTE arrives and asks her name, which she answers as she was instructed by the man.\nThe TTE looks at her and asks for her ID, just to be sure. Her ticket, as it happens, was under the senior citizen quota. The TTE said they are directed to check IDs for passengers with senior citizen tickets. She looked too young to be a senior citizen.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Sidenote: It is a nice quota regardless; it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get confirmed since you won’t be competing with non-seniors, who are the majority of passengers. Since she didn’t have an ID to show the TTE, she called her ‘brother’ the man, who said he would send the Aadhar shortly.\nThe TTE continued his duty in the rest of the coach and the train. He told her he would be back and would have to charge her a fine and ask her to get off if she couldn’t present a valid ID.\nPart 3 - Reflections on the Rail System At this point, I started to wonder about it. It seemed like there was some funny business after all.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e The man had instructed her to tell the TTE, \u0026ldquo;My brother is on his way home and will send the ID when he gets there.\u0026rdquo; TTEs are very skilled, in my opinion. In a coach full of passengers, they can identify potential scams. Such cases are not uncommon. One could argue that the Rail System in India is completely incompetent. People\u0026rsquo;s lives depend on traveling, especially in emergencies. What else can one do but try to \u0026lsquo;bend the rules\u0026rsquo;?\nTraveling during festive seasons is particularly troublesome, as certain busy routes get fully booked months in advance. I often find my usual routes from Bengal to Bihar completely booked half a year ahead of ‘chhath’, with waiting lists going over 200.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e These felt like stalling tactics to me. I assume the TTE thought similarly. She called her brother again and asked if he had sent her ID yet, to which the man replied he had sent one but advised not to show it. Instead, he told her to inform the TTE that he was fetching the ID, while he tried to change the name on it. One could argue that using \u0026lsquo;dalals\u0026rsquo; or brokers to bypass this isn\u0026rsquo;t morally wrong at all. What can one do in an emergency when no tickets are available? Buying tickets on the black market or traveling without one are the only two options.\nBut I argue that these dalals aggravate the already existing problem. These rackets are part of the reason people can’t get a ticket. Buying tickets en masse with different names and ages to sell them on the black market only reduces the number of already scarce tickets available.\nIt’s difficult to round them up. Buying a bunch of tickets isn’t illegal after all.\nThis is what I, and I think the TTE as well, assumed was the case with the woman at first.\nPart 4 - The Job Migrations \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e The TTE returned, adamant, and explained he has to specially check the senior citizen quota tickets. \u0026ldquo;It’s a rule,\u0026rdquo; he explained, and asked her where she was going. “Bangalore,” she replied. The TTE then asked, “What for?” “Kaaj korte,” she replied, which means “to work.” It is a problem in Bengal, as I cite a recent report: “WB loses 3 million informal jobs in the last 7 years,” the highest of any state. It is generally the poor, the economically backward classes who do unskilled informal jobs, which the educated classes of society would rather avoid with the help of education and formal jobs.\nMuch like how educated youth flock to big metropolitan cities such as Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Delhi, Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad after graduating, uneducated youths also move to these cities to look for informal jobs.\nIt’s not formally accounted for, but based on testimonies and circumstantial evidence, a huge migration occurs for the informal sector, similar to the formal ones.\nI’ve had friends speak of finding a Bengali bartender in Chennai, a Bengali repair shop in Bhubaneswar, or a Nepali momo stall in my own hometown.\nWe’ve all heard of the Nithari incident. Nithari is one of many such areas throughout the country, in every metropolitan city—in this case, Noida—where people from poorer states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar flock in such numbers that they form their own colonies. These are pockets of migrants.\nPart 5 - Stalling The TTE returned and asked if her brother had sent her ID yet. Earlier, the man had called the woman and told her to tell the TTE, “my brother is fetching the ID and will send it shortly.” When she asked if he had not sent any ID yet, the man gave a strange reply. He said that although he had sent an ID, it would be better not to show it to the TTE, and he was trying to change the name on an ID and send that instead.\nThe TTE returned and asked her to show her ID again. The woman did not know how to use WhatsApp, so she asked one of the co-passengers to open her WhatsApp and show the ID to the TTE. The co-passenger, a middle-aged man, helped her with that. The TTE saw the “ID” that was sent, and it turned out to be just the ticket, not an ID.\nI reckon the man did this because he did not want to panic the woman by admitting that he had no ID to send.\nHis plan was to play dumb and stall the ID check.\nI wondered how far it would get her though. Getting all the way through to Bangalore seemed unlikely to me. The train did not have frequent stops en route; in fact, it had 5 stops on a 2000km long one-way trip. So stalling just one station would carry her 400km before she could be forced to get off.\nShe might as well get sympathy. An alone, helpless woman being stranded in an unknown location would be a difficult decision for the TTE to make.\nPart 6 - The Trafficking Racket It was at this point that I, and I assume the TTE with me, started to consider the possibility of human trafficking.\nThink about it, a woman traveling in AC class to Bangalore to work menial odd jobs. She appeared so helpless, clueless about trains, and was evidently a villager through her accent. She was unread and couldn’t even speak a word of Hindi. The way she used the phone given to her made it clear it wasn’t natural to her. She would be completely lost in the city, but for the man…\nMy Reflections The man was probably her employer. This seems like one of those rings where they round up broke laborers from poor states, sell them the dream of money and a better life, and then supply them en masse elsewhere. There, they toil away their lives, never able to return, and are quite at the mercy of their employers, as they would be lost in the place they now find themselves working.\nSuch an employer can make them work even without a salary, by just giving them meals to keep them alive. What can someone in her position even do? Even if she found a way to get to the police and communicate with them, it would be pointless.\nOf course, the police are always in on rackets, every single time. The big pimps running the rackets always have the local thana in their pockets. Local thanas everywhere are always sold off to either the local ruling party or the local big pimps, and it continues to be so until something blows completely out of proportion and catches national public attention. Even then, nothing really happens in certain parts of the country, such as Sandeshkhali, Dinajpur.\nThis topic deserves its own article.\nThe stories she must have been fed likely included how she would earn a lot of money and how this would improve her and her family’s life. I say this because these are the stories fed to Indians who reach Arabia, only to do menial construction, cleaning, and assistant/clerk jobs, and get stranded there for life due to a lack of money to send home or even return home.\nSlave labor is well-documented in places like Dubai, where people (especially from South India) arrive with big dreams and high hopes, only to find out they have to sign a contract that says they must work a certain number of years before they can return home.\nThe Ending? Well, I got off at BBS and didn\u0026rsquo;t get the chance to see if the TTE returned, or the man, or whether she reached Bangalore, or what became of her. But in any case, this was my one memorable journey from home to college at the beginning of a new term.\nDo share your thoughts by leaving a comment. We’d love to interact.

It details an encounter with a peculiar co-passenger, a woman who seemed lost and was possibly a victim of human trafficking. This post describes the woman\u0026rsquo;s interactions with the Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) and reflects on the broader issues of job migration and human trafficking in India. Conclusion The story concludes without a resolution, as I disembark at Bhubaneswar (BBS) and don\u0026rsquo;t learn the fate of the woman or whether the TTE\u0026rsquo;s suspicions were confirmed.","title":"One Peculiar Train Experience | The Job Human Trafficking Racket in India","type":"posts"},{"content":" \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: The post emphasizes that while CGPA alone cannot secure a job, it is crucial as the first step in the recruitment process. In many universities, recruiters use CGPA to shortlist candidates, often setting cut-offs higher than the officially stated minimums. Therefore, maintaining a high CGPA is important to advance in the selection process. Students should aim for a CGPA higher than the common average in their college to stay competitive.\nMuch is said about the importance of CGPA or its lack thereof to new students trying to navigate college life and to hopefully get a good job.\nThe popular belief nowadays is that CGPA does not matter and it\u0026rsquo;s only one\u0026rsquo;s skills, specifically coding skills, that matter during the recruitment process.\nHowever, this is only half true. What was originally meant by this sentiment was that CGPA alone cannot get you a job. But after it was repeated enough times, it sort of became axiomatic that CGPA itself is useless and the intended meaning was lost.\nWhat students need to understand is that CGPA is like a ticket to the recruitment process, beyond which it cannot help you anymore and you\u0026rsquo;ve only got your skills to bank on.\nIn the context of on-campus placements, most private universities have thousands of students in just the CSE branch alone, so it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for recruiters to interview each one of them.\nThey use multiple elimination rounds to shortlist a handful of candidates whom they finally consider. CGPA is the very first elimination tool. Even here, the official statements and the advice of seniors are misleading. Even though the official criteria are usually set at 7 or 7.5, when the recruiter finally releases the shortlist, one often notices that all candidates have much higher CGPAs, upwards of 8-8.5. That is because many recruiters try to pick the top X students of a branch, which ends up increasing the CGPA cut-off.\nKeeping all of this in mind, it\u0026rsquo;s advisable to maintain a high CGPA as it serves as your ticket to the later rounds of the recruitment process. How high you should aim for depends totally on your college. Some colleges are very liberal with their grading, so it would be risky to aim for the bare minimum of 7 or 7.5. One should instead pay attention to what CGPA is most common in their college and should aim to maintain higher than that number.\n","date":"August 3, 2024","permalink":"/posts/cgpa/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary: The post emphasizes that while CGPA alone cannot secure a job, it is crucial as the first step in the recruitment process.
