[{"content":" \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary Religion, particularly traditional ones, serves as an abstraction of complex philosophies, much like layers in computing and mathematics. While these abstractions simplify concepts for the masses, they also require faith. This faith connects individuals to the accumulated knowledge and societal structures developed over millennia. Rejecting faith often leads to a disconnection from these deep-rooted philosophies, which have historically guided and improved human societies.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Important Context At the outset, I\u0026rsquo;d like to clarify that I understand the potential of religion as a tool to control masses. Therefore, I\u0026rsquo;d like to distinguish between monotheistic religions (primarily the Abrahamic faiths) and traditional religions. The former is more of an anti-tradition compared to the latter, which is more natural, based on empirical evidence, and is a post hoc analysis of what works. This article focuses on traditional religions. With that in mind, let\u0026rsquo;s begin.\nWhat are Abstractions? In the World of Computers We can use a computer analogy to understand abstractions.\nAt the fundamental level, computers run on electric signals—high and low. To simplify, we say binary (0 \u0026amp; 1) is the computer\u0026rsquo;s language. This is the first level of abstraction. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to write instructions in binary, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to use something more English-like and convert it to binary. So we use assembly languages, and an assembler converts them to binary—a second layer of abstraction. We then use even more English-like languages and convert them into assembly, and so on. Finally, at the highest level of abstraction, we have a UI interface that anyone can use to give instructions to the computer.\nThese abstractions make it easier for us to instruct the computer, but each level also makes our interactions less powerful. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep this example in mind as we explore the rest of the idea.\nIn the World of Mathematics Mathematics is the language we use to understand the real world around us. It uses numbers to represent real-world phenomena. What makes math exceptionally difficult is the limited opportunity to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; it. While basic arithmetic is easy to visualize, more advanced math becomes incredibly \u0026ldquo;abstract.\u0026rdquo; Beyond a certain point, it becomes impossible for the average person to visualize or feel math. Individuals gifted in math can express the real world in numbers. Someone like Newton has the ability to relate math to physical phenomena of the world.\nEven though the average person can\u0026rsquo;t directly relate formulas to the real world, they can still use abstractions to avoid thinking about the underlying concept. Referring back to the computer example, a software programmer can work with programming languages and libraries without fully understanding the underlying architecture.\nFaith There are broadly two ways to understand any topic: you can feel it, or it\u0026rsquo;s down to your cognitive ability to think in abstractions.\nHowever, in the absence of both, there\u0026rsquo;s a third way to utilize a complex system to your advantage—faith.\nEven if the idea in question isn\u0026rsquo;t directly tied to any physical experience and you lack the cognitive ability to think in abstractions, you can put faith in a higher level of abstraction created by someone else. Just as the average user trusts the programmer who created the UI and uses the UI layer to achieve their goals, and students of math mostly utilize formulas they don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand, one can put faith in the higher abstracted layers of a complex system.\nReligion Tradition-based \u0026ldquo;folk religions\u0026rdquo; are not dogmatic. They perform a post hoc analysis of what works, which then turns into tradition. In the past, these religions have been the guiding principles of entire civilizations. From economics to family and the individual, religions have provided a complete framework. The modern interpretation of religion as personal worship of a \u0026ldquo;sky daddy\u0026rdquo; is naive and reductionist.\nIn reality, the existence of a higher being called \u0026ldquo;god\u0026rdquo; is of little consequence. Religion is a framework to govern societies. With this in mind, we can see interesting parallels in modern societies. Nations today follow a constitution, based on generally agreed-upon principles among the citizens. That a constitution isn\u0026rsquo;t objective truth can be inferred from the fact that countries have vastly different ideals set in their constitutions, yet they\u0026rsquo;re all still functional. Similarly, worship of the ideals set in a constitution is generally observed worldwide. A constitution is a sacred document for a country and is revered as such by its citizens.\nUpon the Rejection of Faith A religion is the abstraction of philosophies.\nIt aims to bring the realization of philosophical theories and principles to the masses and apply them to form and maintain a better society.\nIt is a method that has helped us for millennia to distinguish ourselves as a species unique in its thoughts and singular in its application of those thoughts. What it requires is faith.\nThe reason people who denounce faith suffer is that they disconnect themselves from the philosophies and human nature that comprise their culture. They abstain from millennia of thought, accumulated knowledge, and reflections. They remove themselves from the system designed for their specific needs by generations of ancestors, without realizing that their forebears designed and followed it so their progeny could have a better life and live by good morals, ensuring that the society their children inhabit is not morally apathetic.\n","date":"August 23, 2024","permalink":"/posts/abstractions/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary Religion, particularly traditional ones, serves as an abstraction of complex philosophies, much like layers in computing and mathematics.

However I’d like to point out the parallels of Abstraction between Science and Religion.\nOr how i call it:\nScience as a Modern Religion The latest development in human history is what I call the religion of science. It’s based on the same levels of abstraction that many complex systems governing humanity follow. Remember when scientists, governments, news outlets, and big international science institutions collectively advised people to trust the system and follow directions during the pandemic, strictly advising against individual research?\nThe modern religion of science works by enforcing policies for the general public, which are abstractions of scientific principles. It\u0026rsquo;s a pursuit that few choose to dedicate their entire lives to following.\n","date":"August 23, 2024","permalink":"/posts/abstractions_footnote/","summary":"Similarities in complex systems Academic level mathematics is close to Religion in the sense that it is a post hoc analysis of a phenomenon, represented in laws and formulas.

It details an encounter with a peculiar co-passenger, a woman who seemed lost and was possibly a victim of human trafficking. This post describes the woman\u0026rsquo;s interactions with the Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) and reflects on the broader issues of job migration and human trafficking in India. Conclusion\nThe story concludes without a resolution, as I disembark at Bhubaneswar (BBS) and don\u0026rsquo;t learn the fate of the woman or whether the TTE\u0026rsquo;s suspicions were confirmed. The post and the story however, highlights the vulnerabilities of migrant workers and the systemic issues that facilitate human trafficking.\nBackground Where On a train, on the route: Howrah - Bangalore\nWhen One fine August, 2024\nWhat The train was 4 hours late, disrupting my day and giving me a stiff neck and back from sitting and waiting all day.\nWhen I finally got up, it was even more painful on my berth, as more sitting awaited me among an equally tired crowd in the same predicament as myself.\nSitting with me, however, was a woman who caught my attention. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t pinpoint what it was—maybe her overall \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m completely lost, but I can\u0026rsquo;t be obvious about it\u0026rdquo; vibe, or the fact that she looked different from everyone else in my AC coach, including myself. She frankly didn\u0026rsquo;t look well off at all\u0026hellip;\nThis one is about her.\nExperience Part 1 - Peculiar Co-Passenger She boarded with me in Howrah, and as things settled down, I noticed the man with her gave her a phone and coached her on what to say as her name when the TTE asked.\nHe left after a quick \u0026ldquo;Are you afraid?\u0026rdquo; directed at her in an attempt to reassure her. This gave me the impression that she was a first-time solo traveler. I assumed the man had a ticket for a different coach, as often happens when tickets aren\u0026rsquo;t booked together, and he went to his respective coach.\nMy stop, BBS, didn\u0026rsquo;t cover the entire route the train would take, not even half of it. I would reach in a few hours, barring delays, so I refrained from ordering food. The other guy beside me ate his lunch and then went to his upper berth.\nMine was the middle berth, and although I wanted to rest, I had to wait for my co-passenger, the woman I\u0026rsquo;ve been describing so far, to decide to rest as well so I could have my berth.\nHowever, she had different plans. She was just sitting there. Just sitting. It\u0026rsquo;s rare to find someone sitting idle in today’s age of smart distractions. I went to the washroom, not particularly worried because I had light luggage. When I returned, I saw that she had picked up all her luggage from the floor and covered the seat with it.\nShe was now taking up half the seat with herself and her multiple cloth and jute bags (jhola and bora). Well, I guess half a berth is still more space than a chair car, like my last experience. She was particularly worried about her luggage. Even in a comparatively safer AC coach, she told the other passengers to watch her luggage for her when she went to the washroom.\nPart 2 - Co-passenger Gets into Trouble The TTE arrives and asks her name, which she answers as she was instructed by the man.\nThe TTE looks at her and asks for her ID, just to be sure. Her ticket, as it happens, was under the senior citizen quota. The TTE said they are directed to check IDs for passengers with senior citizen tickets. She looked too young to be a senior citizen.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e Sidenote: It is a nice quota regardless; it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get confirmed since you won’t be competing with non-seniors, who are the majority of passengers. Since she didn’t have an ID to show the TTE, she called her ‘brother’ the man, who said he would send the Aadhar shortly.\nThe TTE continued his duty in the rest of the coach and the train. He told her he would be back and would have to charge her a fine and ask her to get off if she couldn’t present a valid ID.\nPart 3 - Reflections on the Rail System At this point, I started to wonder about it. It seemed like there was some funny business after all.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e The man had instructed her to tell the TTE, \u0026ldquo;My brother is on his way home and will send the ID when he gets there.\u0026rdquo; TTEs are very skilled, in my opinion. In a coach full of passengers, they can identify potential scams. Such cases are not uncommon. One could argue that the Rail System in India is completely incompetent. People\u0026rsquo;s lives depend on traveling, especially in emergencies. What else can one do but try to \u0026lsquo;bend the rules\u0026rsquo;?\nTraveling during festive seasons is particularly troublesome, as certain busy routes get fully booked months in advance. I often find my usual routes from Bengal to Bihar completely booked half a year ahead of ‘chhath’, with waiting lists going over 200.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e These felt like stalling tactics to me. I assume the TTE thought similarly. She called her brother again and asked if he had sent her ID yet, to which the man replied he had sent one but advised not to show it. Instead, he told her to inform the TTE that he was fetching the ID, while he tried to change the name on it. One could argue that using \u0026lsquo;dalals\u0026rsquo; or brokers to bypass this isn\u0026rsquo;t morally wrong at all. What can one do in an emergency when no tickets are available? Buying tickets on the black market or traveling without one are the only two options.\nBut I argue that these dalals aggravate the already existing problem. These rackets are part of the reason people can’t get a ticket. Buying tickets en masse with different names and ages to sell them on the black market only reduces the number of already scarce tickets available.\nIt’s difficult to round them up. Buying a bunch of tickets isn’t illegal after all.\nThis is what I, and I think the TTE as well, assumed was the case with the woman at first.\nPart 4 - The Job Migrations \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e The TTE returned, adamant, and explained he has to specially check the senior citizen quota tickets. \u0026ldquo;It’s a rule,\u0026rdquo; he explained, and asked her where she was going. “Bangalore,” she replied. The TTE then asked, “What for?” “Kaaj korte,” she replied, which means “to work.” It is a problem in Bengal, as I cite a recent report: “WB loses 3 million informal jobs in the last 7 years,” the highest of any state. It is generally the poor, the economically backward classes who do unskilled informal jobs, which the educated classes of society would rather avoid with the help of education and formal jobs.\nMuch like how educated youth flock to big metropolitan cities such as Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Delhi, Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Ahmedabad after graduating, uneducated youths also move to these cities to look for informal jobs.\nIt’s not formally accounted for, but based on testimonies and circumstantial evidence, a huge migration occurs for the informal sector, similar to the formal ones.\nI’ve had friends speak of finding a Bengali bartender in Chennai, a Bengali repair shop in Bhubaneswar, or a Nepali momo stall in my own hometown.\nWe’ve all heard of the Nithari incident. Nithari is one of many such areas throughout the country, in every metropolitan city—in this case, Noida—where people from poorer states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar flock in such numbers that they form their own colonies. These are pockets of migrants.\nPart 5 - Stalling The TTE returned and asked if her brother had sent her ID yet. Earlier, the man had called the woman and told her to tell the TTE, “my brother is fetching the ID and will send it shortly.” When she asked if he had not sent any ID yet, the man gave a strange reply. He said that although he had sent an ID, it would be better not to show it to the TTE, and he was trying to change the name on an ID and send that instead.\nThe TTE returned and asked her to show her ID again. The woman did not know how to use WhatsApp, so she asked one of the co-passengers to open her WhatsApp and show the ID to the TTE. The co-passenger, a middle-aged man, helped her with that. The TTE saw the “ID” that was sent, and it turned out to be just the ticket, not an ID.\nI reckon the man did this because he did not want to panic the woman by admitting that he had no ID to send.\nHis plan was to play dumb and stall the ID check.\nI wondered how far it would get her though. Getting all the way through to Bangalore seemed unlikely to me. The train did not have frequent stops en route; in fact, it had 5 stops on a 2000km long one-way trip. So stalling just one station would carry her 400km before she could be forced to get off.\nShe might as well get sympathy. An alone, helpless woman being stranded in an unknown location would be a difficult decision for the TTE to make.\nPart 6 - The Trafficking Racket It was at this point that I, and I assume the TTE with me, started to consider the possibility of human trafficking.\nThink about it, a woman traveling in AC class to Bangalore to work menial odd jobs. She appeared so helpless, clueless about trains, and was evidently a villager through her accent. She was unread and couldn’t even speak a word of Hindi. The way she used the phone given to her made it clear it wasn’t natural to her. She would be completely lost in the city, but for the man…\nMy Reflections The man was probably her employer. This seems like one of those rings where they round up broke laborers from poor states, sell them the dream of money and a better life, and then supply them en masse elsewhere. There, they toil away their lives, never able to return, and are quite at the mercy of their employers, as they would be lost in the place they now find themselves working.\nSuch an employer can make them work even without a salary, by just giving them meals to keep them alive. What can someone in her position even do? Even if she found a way to get to the police and communicate with them, it would be pointless.\nOf course, the police are always in on rackets, every single time. The big pimps running the rackets always have the local thana in their pockets. Local thanas everywhere are always sold off to either the local ruling party or the local big pimps, and it continues to be so until something blows completely out of proportion and catches national public attention. Even then, nothing really happens in certain parts of the country, such as Sandeshkhali, Dinajpur.\nThis topic deserves its own article.\nThe stories she must have been fed likely included how she would earn a lot of money and how this would improve her and her family’s life. I say this because these are the stories fed to Indians who reach Arabia, only to do menial construction, cleaning, and assistant/clerk jobs, and get stranded there for life due to a lack of money to send home or even return home.\nSlave labor is well-documented in places like Dubai, where people (especially from South India) arrive with big dreams and high hopes, only to find out they have to sign a contract that says they must work a certain number of years before they can return home.\nThe Ending? Well, I got off at BBS and didn\u0026rsquo;t get the chance to see if the TTE returned, or the man, or whether she reached Bangalore, or what became of her. But in any case, this was my one memorable journey from home to college at the beginning of a new term.\nDo share your thoughts by leaving a comment. We’d love to interact.

In many universities, recruiters use CGPA to shortlist candidates, often setting cut-offs higher than the officially stated minimums. Therefore, maintaining a high CGPA is important to advance in the selection process. Students should aim for a CGPA higher than the common average in their college to stay competitive.\nMuch is said about the importance of CGPA or its lack thereof to new students trying to navigate college life and to hopefully get a good job.\nThe popular belief nowadays is that CGPA does not matter and it\u0026rsquo;s only one\u0026rsquo;s skills, specifically coding skills, that matter during the recruitment process.\nHowever, this is only half true. What was originally meant by this sentiment was that CGPA alone cannot get you a job. But after it was repeated enough times, it sort of became axiomatic that CGPA itself is useless and the intended meaning was lost.\nWhat students need to understand is that CGPA is like a ticket to the recruitment process, beyond which it cannot help you anymore and you\u0026rsquo;ve only got your skills to bank on.\nIn the context of on-campus placements, most private universities have thousands of students in just the CSE branch alone, so it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for recruiters to interview each one of them.\nThey use multiple elimination rounds to shortlist a handful of candidates whom they finally consider. CGPA is the very first elimination tool. Even here, the official statements and the advice of seniors are misleading. Even though the official criteria are usually set at 7 or 7.5, when the recruiter finally releases the shortlist, one often notices that all candidates have much higher CGPAs, upwards of 8-8.5. That is because many recruiters try to pick the top X students of a branch, which ends up increasing the CGPA cut-off.\nKeeping all of this in mind, it\u0026rsquo;s advisable to maintain a high CGPA as it serves as your ticket to the later rounds of the recruitment process. How high you should aim for depends totally on your college. Some colleges are very liberal with their grading, so it would be risky to aim for the bare minimum of 7 or 7.5. One should instead pay attention to what CGPA is most common in their college and should aim to maintain higher than that number.\n","date":"August 3, 2024","permalink":"/posts/cgpa/","summary":"\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\"?\u003e TLDR - Summary The post emphasizes that while CGPA alone cannot secure a job, it is crucial as the first step in the recruitment process.
