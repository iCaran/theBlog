## <u>TLDR - Summary:</u>
Society could improve by encouraging honest self-interest rather than unrealistic ideals of universal morality. Many genuinely follow altruistic values, often at their own expense, while others openly prioritize their interests—leading to frustration and betrayal. When everyone is upfront about their goals, interactions could become more transparent and mutually beneficial. Cohesive minority groups already thrive by openly advocating for their own interests, while the fragmented majority often falls short due to misplaced guilt-driven values. Embracing pragmatic self-interest could create a more functional, realistic society.

## <u>Introduction</u>

In a world where lofty ideals of altruism and morality guide much of our societal and political frameworks, a fundamental question arises: *Does the system truly work for everyone?* An honest, introspective view suggests that the world’s woes stem not from a lack of goodwill but from the illusion that everyone operates on shared ethical principles. Many suffer, not because they fail to try but because they unwittingly believe in these ideals while others pursue their self-interests openly. Perhaps, if society encouraged honest self-interest, we could achieve a more functional, transparent world.

## <u>The Flaws of Universal Morality</u>

Morality is often taught as an absolute, yet this notion falls apart in practice. "Value education," as idealistic as it seems, has little grounding in real life, as people’s diverse moral compasses rarely align. Even a small number of people who disregard ethics can disrupt an entire system. Hence, it may be more practical for everyone to admit what they truly desire rather than to pretend to be motivated by universal ethics. Open self-interest could foster more genuine negotiations and solutions, as people would no longer be bound by the need to disguise their intentions under a veil of altruism.

In today's world what usually happens is that one party strives for these altruistic ideals at the cost of their own self interest, this is a recipe for disaster because it also builds expectations from others to do the same, when infact, in most cases, others don't reciprocate. This will ultimately lead to resentment and a feeling of betrayal. It would be better if both parties were honest about what they really want and then try to negotiate from there. This would be healthier as it addresses everyone's concern and there's no hidden expectations that might never materialise.

## <u>Minority Coordination vs. Majority Complacency</u>

A striking pattern in societies worldwide is that minority communities often thrive despite adversity, while majority groups struggle with complacency. Small, cohesive interest groups—whether religious minorities, ethnic communities, or economic alliances—are naturally pressured to coordinate and advocate for their collective welfare. This alignment creates informed, organized groups that can consistently achieve their objectives, often besting a large but fragmented majority. By contrast, the majority often march toward self-sabotage, shackled by guilt-driven values that may not serve their actual interests.

## <u>Human Nature and Animal Instincts</u>

The resemblance between human and animal instincts in survival situations reveals an underlying truth: complex behavior does not necessarily equate to superior ethics or intelligence. We often extend moral sympathy to a poor person driven to crime by necessity, acknowledging that dire circumstances sometimes necessitate a return to primal behaviors. However, society frowns upon individuals who openly operate on survival-based principles, labeling such behavior as “evil.” This contradiction suggests that while humanity aspires to evolve beyond animal instincts, these instincts remain deeply embedded, manifesting especially under pressure.

## <u>Conclusion</u>

In conclusion, the pursuit of a pragmatic self-interest model, wherein individuals are encouraged to be transparent about their desires, may offer a realistic alternative to the current, idealistic frameworks. A society where individuals openly prioritize their self-interests, rather than concealing them under the guise of morality or altruism, could lead to more efficient and sincere interactions. Though this approach demands honesty—a trait that may not come easily to all—it could align more closely with the true nature of human behavior, navigating the complexities of human instincts and societal roles with a grounded, practical outlook.
