## <u>Similarities in complex systems</u>

Academic level mathematics is close to Religion in the sense that it is a post hoc analysis of a phenomenon, represented in laws and formulas. So the application of simple formulas become the (very) useful application of the science, just as customs when it comes to religions.
One can easily see how denouncing the formulas, theories, axioms and laws entirely created by a Newton or an Einstein or the generations of great minds, without ever understanding the core concept at play, does more harm than good. Yet there is much support and debate over the denouncing of Faith and Religion without ever truly understanding them.

## <u>Footnote</u>

{{< callout Sq_blank>}}
**<u>Important context</u>**: From here on out, I’ll use the modern concept of religion, the better known definition of it, stemming from the Abrahamic roots, because that’s what modern religions are like.
I understand how a through atheist may dismiss this line of reasoning and religion altogether for a (on the surface) better alternative of Science and scientific reasons to the great questions of the human psyche and the nature of the world containing it. However I’d like to point out the parallels of Abstraction between Science and Religion. 

Or how i call it:

### <u>Science as a Modern Religion</u>

The latest development in human history is what I call the religion of science. It’s based on the same levels of abstraction that many complex systems governing humanity follow. Remember when scientists, governments, news outlets, and big international science institutions collectively advised people to trust the system and follow directions during the pandemic, strictly advising against individual research?

The modern religion of science works by enforcing policies for the general public, which are abstractions of scientific principles. It's a pursuit that few choose to dedicate their entire lives to following.
